      '"The Senate is on track to pass a mammoth $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package Wednesday evening after leaders agreed to an amendment vote aimed at appeasing a small group of GOP senators, overcoming a last-minute hurdle that had delayed quick passage of the bipartisan deal. At issue is language surrounding beefed-up unemployment insurance, which they say would allow workers to be paid more on unemployment than what they were making while employed. To mollify those concerns, leaders have agreed to allow an amendment vote on the floor, according to sources familiar with the matter. After that vote — which is expected to fail — senators can turn to final passage, sending it over to the House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi chided the GOP quartet for holding up the historic package, especially since it has bipartisan support from congressional leaders and the White House. ""We’re talking about $600,"" Pelosi said in an interview on ""PBS NewsHour"" Wednesday evening. ""People are scared, they’re in need, they have additional expenses. I don’t need to explain that to you."" The emergency package, the largest of its kind in U.S. history, comes after five days of tense negotiations between Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. It includes a dramatic expansion of unemployment insurance, a rescue fund for state and local governments, immediate cash for hospitals and a huge pool of grants and loans for small businesses. The House, meanwhile, is expected to take up the bill as early as Thursday evening. Democratic leaders have promised to give members a 24-hour notice before the scheduled vote. And Pelosi and her leadership team spent much of the day on conference calls briefing their members about the plan, even as the bill text was held up in the Senate.

""This is not even a stimulus package — it’s emergency relief,"" McConnell said. Ahead of the bill’s release, Mnuchin huddled with Senate Republicans on a conference call and senators have been given near-final drafts to review. Pelosi had originally hoped to bring the bill up via unanimous consent after Senate passage, a voting method that would not force lawmakers to return to Washington.

There has been plenty of last-minute drama with the Senate package. A furious New York Governor Andrew Cuomo held an emergency call with the House’s New York delegation at 11 a.m., where he told them “New York is dead"" and they needed to push for a stronger package, according to people familiar with the call.

Shortly after, Schumer, who represents New York and signed off on the bill, organized his own teleconference for his state’s delegation to help rally support for the bill. Still, Democrats have touted wins in the package, including $130 billion in funding for hospitals; a massive temporary expansion of unemployment benefits; federal oversight of a $500 billion fund to aid distressed industries; and a prohibition on access to loans or investments from the new programs to any of Trump’s personal businesses.

      "\"WASHINGTON -- Senate leaders raced to unravel last-minute snags Wednesday and win passage of an unparalleled $2 trillion economic rescue package steering aid to businesses, workers and health care systems engulfed by the coronavirus pandemic. The measure is the largest economic relief bill in history, and both parties' leaders were desperate for quick passage of a bill aimed at a virus that is costing lives and jobs by the hour. The package is intended as a weekslong or monthslong patch for an economy spiraling into recession or worse and a nation facing a grim toll from an infection that's killed nearly 20,000 people worldwide. Underscoring the effort's sheer magnitude, the bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion annual federal budget. \"\"A fight has arrived on our shores,\"\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \"\"We did not seek it, we did not want it, but now we're going to win it.\"\" \"\"Big help, quick help, is on the way,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. But the drive by leaders to speed the bill through the Senate was slowed as four conservative Republican senators demanded changes, saying the legislation as written “incentivizes layoffs\"\" and should be altered to ensure employees don't earn more money if they're laid off than if they're working. Complicating the standoff, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination has flagged, said he would block the bill unless the conservatives dropped their objections. Other objections floated in from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has become a prominent Democrat on the national scene as the country battles the pandemic. Cuomo, whose state has seen more deaths from the pandemic than any other, said: “I'm telling you, these numbers don't work.\"\" Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said the package “goes a long way.\"\" He said it will require strong oversight to ensure the wealthy don't benefit at the expense of workers and proposed forgiving at least $10,000 of student loan debt as part of the federal response. McConnell and Schumer hoped passage of the legislation in the Republican-led Senate would come by the end of the day. After a banner day on Tuesday as the package took shape, the stock market rallied even more on Wednesday. Senate passage would leave final congressional approval up to the Democratic-controlled House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the bipartisan agreement “takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people” but she stopped short of fully endorsing it. “House Democrats will now review the final provisions and legislative text of the agreement to determine a course of action,” she said. House members are scattered around the country and the timetable for votes in that chamber is unclear. House Democratic and Republican leaders have hoped to clear the measure for President Donald Trump's signature by a voice vote without having to call lawmakers back to Washington. But that may prove challenging, as the bill is sure to be opposed by some conservatives upset at its cost and scope. Ardent liberals were restless as well. White House aide Eric Ueland announced the agreement in a Capitol hallway Wednesday, shortly after midnight, capping days of often intense haggling and mounting pressure. The wording of some final pieces of the agreement need to be completed. The sprawling, 500-page-plus measure is the third coronavirus response bill produced by Congress and by far the largest. It builds on efforts focused on vaccines and emergency response, sick and family medical leave for workers, and food aid. It would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines. Hospitals would get significant help as well. McConnell, a key negotiator, said the package will “rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation's health care fight. And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help Americans workers, families, small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar.\"\" Five days of arduous talks produced the bill, creating tensions among Congress' top leaders, who each took care to tend to party politics as they maneuvered and battled over crafting the legislation. But failure was never an option, which permitted both sides to mark big wins. “That Washington drama does not matter any more,” McConnell said. “The Senate is going to stand together, act together, and pass this historic relief package today.” The bill would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year, and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child A huge cash infusion for hospitals expecting a flood of COVID-19 patients grew during the talks at Schumer's insistence. Republicans pressed for tens of billions of dollars for additional relief to be delivered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the lead federal disaster agency. Democrats said the package would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time. Schumer said businesses controlled by members of Congress and top administration officials — including Trump and his immediate family members — would be ineligible for the bill's business assistance. The New York Democrat immediately sent out a roster of negotiating wins for transit systems, hospital, and cash-hungry state governments that were cemented after Democrats blocked the measure in votes held Sunday and Monday to maneuver for such gains. But Cuomo said the Senate package would send less than $4 billion to New York, far short of his estimate that the crisis will cost his state up to $15 billion over the next year. More than 280 New Yorkers have died from the virus, a death toll more than double that of any other state. Pelosi was a force behind $400 million in grants to states to expand voting by mail and other steps that Democrats billed as making voting safer but Republican critics said was political opportunism. The package also contains $15.5 billion more for a surge in demand for food stamps. Republicans won inclusion of an “employee retention” tax credit that's estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50% of workers' paychecks. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax. A companion appropriations package ballooned as well, growing from a $46 billion White House proposal to more than $300 billion, which dwarfs earlier disasters — including Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy combined. To provide transparency, the package is expected to create a new inspector general and oversight board for the corporate dollars, much as was done during the 2008 bank rescue, officials said. Europe is enacting its own economic recovery packages, with huge amounts of credit guarantees, government spending and other support. Germany alone, Europe's biggest economy, has agreed to commit over 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion) in fiscal stimulus and support — roughly 30 percent of that nation's entire annual output. France, Spain and Italy have launched similar programs. The European Union has suspended limits it imposes on member countries' borrowing and deficits, freeing them to spend more. Some of Europe's fiscal stimulus kicks in automatically without any new legislation due to social welfare safety nets that are more extensive than in the U.S. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death. In the United States, more than 55,000 people have been sickened and more than 800 have died. Associated Press writers Lolita C. Baldor, Zeke Miller, Mary Clare Jalonick, Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Alan Fram and Padmananda Rama contributed to this report. \"",

      "\"WASHINGTON -- Senate leaders raced to unravel last-minute snags Wednesday and win passage of an unparalleled $2 trillion economic rescue package steering aid to businesses, workers and health care systems engulfed by the coronavirus pandemic. The measure is the largest economic relief bill in history, and both parties' leaders were desperate for quick passage of a bill aimed at a virus that is costing lives and jobs by the hour. The package is intended as a weekslong or monthslong patch for an economy spiraling into recession or worse and a nation facing a grim toll from an infection that's killed nearly 20,000 people worldwide. Underscoring the effort's sheer magnitude, the bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion annual federal budget. \"\"A fight has arrived on our shores,\"\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \"\"We did not seek it, we did not want it, but now we're going to win it.\"\" \"\"Big help, quick help, is on the way,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. But the drive by leaders to speed the bill through the Senate was slowed as four conservative Republican senators demanded changes, saying the legislation as written “incentivizes layoffs\"\" and should be altered to ensure employees don't earn more money if they're laid off than if they're working. Complicating the standoff, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination has flagged, said he would block the bill unless the conservatives dropped their objections. Other objections floated in from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has become a prominent Democrat on the national scene as the country battles the pandemic. Cuomo, whose state has seen more deaths from the pandemic than any other, said: “I'm telling you, these numbers don't work.\"\" Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said the package “goes a long way.\"\" He said it will require strong oversight to ensure the wealthy don't benefit at the expense of workers and proposed forgiving at least $10,000 of student loan debt as part of the federal response. McConnell and Schumer hoped passage of the legislation in the Republican-led Senate would come by the end of the day. After a banner day on Tuesday as the package took shape, the stock market rallied even more on Wednesday. Senate passage would leave final congressional approval up to the Democratic-controlled House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the bipartisan agreement “takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people” but she stopped short of fully endorsing it. “House Democrats will now review the final provisions and legislative text of the agreement to determine a course of action,” she said. House members are scattered around the country and the timetable for votes in that chamber is unclear. House Democratic and Republican leaders have hoped to clear the measure for President Donald Trump's signature by a voice vote without having to call lawmakers back to Washington. But that may prove challenging, as the bill is sure to be opposed by some conservatives upset at its cost and scope. Ardent liberals were restless as well. White House aide Eric Ueland announced the agreement in a Capitol hallway Wednesday, shortly after midnight, capping days of often intense haggling and mounting pressure. The wording of some final pieces of the agreement need to be completed. The sprawling, 500-page-plus measure is the third coronavirus response bill produced by Congress and by far the largest. It builds on efforts focused on vaccines and emergency response, sick and family medical leave for workers, and food aid. It would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines. Hospitals would get significant help as well. McConnell, a key negotiator, said the package will “rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation's health care fight. And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help Americans workers, families, small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar.\"\" Five days of arduous talks produced the bill, creating tensions among Congress' top leaders, who each took care to tend to party politics as they maneuvered and battled over crafting the legislation. But failure was never an option, which permitted both sides to mark big wins. “That Washington drama does not matter any more,” McConnell said. “The Senate is going to stand together, act together, and pass this historic relief package today.” The bill would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year, and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child A huge cash infusion for hospitals expecting a flood of COVID-19 patients grew during the talks at Schumer's insistence. Republicans pressed for tens of billions of dollars for additional relief to be delivered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the lead federal disaster agency. Democrats said the package would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time. Schumer said businesses controlled by members of Congress and top administration officials — including Trump and his immediate family members — would be ineligible for the bill's business assistance. The New York Democrat immediately sent out a roster of negotiating wins for transit systems, hospital, and cash-hungry state governments that were cemented after Democrats blocked the measure in votes held Sunday and Monday to maneuver for such gains. But Cuomo said the Senate package would send less than $4 billion to New York, far short of his estimate that the crisis will cost his state up to $15 billion over the next year. More than 280 New Yorkers have died from the virus, a death toll more than double that of any other state. Pelosi was a force behind $400 million in grants to states to expand voting by mail and other steps that Democrats billed as making voting safer but Republican critics said was political opportunism. The package also contains $15.5 billion more for a surge in demand for food stamps. Republicans won inclusion of an “employee retention” tax credit that's estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50% of workers' paychecks. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax. A companion appropriations package ballooned as well, growing from a $46 billion White House proposal to more than $300 billion, which dwarfs earlier disasters — including Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy combined. To provide transparency, the package is expected to create a new inspector general and oversight board for the corporate dollars, much as was done during the 2008 bank rescue, officials said. Europe is enacting its own economic recovery packages, with huge amounts of credit guarantees, government spending and other support. Germany alone, Europe's biggest economy, has agreed to commit over 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion) in fiscal stimulus and support — roughly 30 percent of that nation's entire annual output. France, Spain and Italy have launched similar programs. The European Union has suspended limits it imposes on member countries' borrowing and deficits, freeing them to spend more. Some of Europe's fiscal stimulus kicks in automatically without any new legislation due to social welfare safety nets that are more extensive than in the U.S. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death. In the United States, more than 55,000 people have been sickened and more than 800 have died. Associated Press writers Lolita C.

At issue is language surrounding beefed-up unemployment insurance, which they say would allow workers to be paid more on unemployment than what they were making while employed. To mollify those concerns, leaders have agreed to allow an amendment vote on the floor, according to sources familiar with the matter. After that vote — which is expected to fail — senators can turn to final passage, sending it over to the House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi chided the GOP quartet for holding up the historic package, especially since it has bipartisan support from congressional leaders and the White House. ""We’re talking about $600,"" Pelosi said in an interview on ""PBS NewsHour"" Wednesday evening. ""People are scared, they’re in need, they have additional expenses. I don’t need to explain that to you.""

The House, meanwhile, is expected to take up the bill as early as Thursday evening. Democratic leaders have promised to give members a 24-hour notice before the scheduled vote. And Pelosi and her leadership team spent much of the day on conference calls briefing their members about the plan, even as the bill text was held up in the Senate. It is Congress’ third major bill in response to the crisis, which has infected 55,500 Americans and brought the U.S. economy to a standstill, and will not be the last. ""Today, the Senate will act to help the people of this country weather this storm,” McConnell said in an emotional speech about how the nation would fight and beat the coronavirus crisis. “Our nation needed us to go big and go fast and they did."" ""This is not even a stimulus package — it’s emergency relief,"" McConnell said. Ahead of the bill’s release, Mnuchin huddled with Senate Republicans on a conference call and senators have been given near-final drafts to review. Pelosi had originally hoped to bring the bill up via unanimous consent after Senate passage, a voting method that would not force lawmakers to return to Washington. But she said later Wednesday that House leaders were looking at other options, noting that at least some Republicans were on their way to Capitol Hill to object to the legislation when it moves to the House.

House Republican leaders have privately acknowledged that there\'s a strong possibility that a member will object to a unanimous consent agreement. There has been plenty of last-minute drama with the Senate package. A furious New York Governor Andrew Cuomo held an emergency call with the House’s New York delegation at 11 a.m., where he told them “New York is dead"" and they needed to push for a stronger package, according to people familiar with the call. Cuomo later grew emotional during a press conference, lashing out at the Senate’s bill as “a drop in the bucket” for his state, which now has 30,611 coronavirus cases. Shortly after, Schumer, who represents New York and signed off on the bill, organized his own teleconference for his state’s delegation to help rally support for the bill. Still, Democrats have touted wins in the package, including $130 billion in funding for hospitals; a massive temporary expansion of unemployment benefits; federal oversight of a $500 billion fund to aid distressed industries; and a prohibition on access to loans or investments from the new programs to any of Trump’s personal businesses. Republican aides, however, accused Schumer of exaggerating some of his “wins” and countered that the GOP never objected to more money for hospitals or oversight of the $500 billion fund for corporations.

      '"The Senate is on track to pass a mammoth $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package Wednesday evening after leaders agreed to an amendment vote aimed at appeasing a small group of GOP senators, overcoming a last-minute hurdle that had delayed quick passage of the bipartisan deal. At issue is language surrounding beefed-up unemployment insurance, which they say would allow workers to be paid more on unemployment than what they were making while employed. To mollify those concerns, leaders have agreed to allow an amendment vote on the floor, according to sources familiar with the matter. After that vote — which is expected to fail — senators can turn to final passage, sending it over to the House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi chided the GOP quartet for holding up the historic package, especially since it has bipartisan support from congressional leaders and the White House. ""We’re talking about $600,"" Pelosi said in an interview on ""PBS NewsHour"" Wednesday evening. ""People are scared, they’re in need, they have additional expenses. I don’t need to explain that to you."" The emergency package, the largest of its kind in U.S. history, comes after five days of tense negotiations between Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. It includes a dramatic expansion of unemployment insurance, a rescue fund for state and local governments, immediate cash for hospitals and a huge pool of grants and loans for small businesses. The House, meanwhile, is expected to take up the bill as early as Thursday evening. Democratic leaders have promised to give members a 24-hour notice before the scheduled vote. And Pelosi and her leadership team spent much of the day on conference calls briefing their members about the plan, even as the bill text was held up in the Senate. It is Congress’ third major bill in response to the crisis, which has infected 55,500 Americans and brought the U.S. economy to a standstill, and will not be the last. ""Today, the Senate will act to help the people of this country weather this storm,” McConnell said in an emotional speech about how the nation would fight and beat the coronavirus crisis. “Our nation needed us to go big and go fast and they did."" ""This is not even a stimulus package — it’s emergency relief,"" McConnell said. Ahead of the bill’s release, Mnuchin huddled with Senate Republicans on a conference call and senators have been given near-final drafts to review. Pelosi had originally hoped to bring the bill up via unanimous consent after Senate passage, a voting method that would not force lawmakers to return to Washington. But she said later Wednesday that House leaders were looking at other options, noting that at least some Republicans were on their way to Capitol Hill to object to the legislation when it moves to the House. Congressional leaders are now hoping to pass the package in the House with a voice vote — similar to unanimous consent in that members aren\'t required to be present but the lawmakers in the chamber can verbally register their opposition or support. The Democratic whip team is also figuring out a process for potential proxy voting, which would require a rule change but would mean fewer members have to return to the Capitol compared to a roll call vote. Still, a single member could object and demand a roll call vote. Pelosi has already advised her members that they may need to return to Washington, telling Democrats Wednesday that House leaders are talking to Capitol Police and the attending physician in preparation. House Republican leaders have privately acknowledged that there\'s a strong possibility that a member will object to a unanimous consent agreement. There has been plenty of last-minute drama with the Senate package. A furious New York Governor Andrew Cuomo held an emergency call with the House’s New York delegation at 11 a.m., where he told them “New York is dead"" and they needed to push for a stronger package, according to people familiar with the call. Cuomo later grew emotional during a press conference, lashing out at the Senate’s bill as “a drop in the bucket” for his state, which now has 30,611 coronavirus cases. Shortly after, Schumer, who represents New York and signed off on the bill, organized his own teleconference for his state’s delegation to help rally support for the bill. Still, Democrats have touted wins in the package, including $130 billion in funding for hospitals; a massive temporary expansion of unemployment benefits; federal oversight of a $500 billion fund to aid distressed industries; and a prohibition on access to loans or investments from the new programs to any of Trump’s personal businesses. Republican aides, however, accused Schumer of exaggerating some of his “wins” and countered that the GOP never objected to more money for hospitals or oversight of the $500 billion fund for corporations. Pelosi and other top Democrats have been fielding questions and complaints from their caucus in a series of calls Wednesday as rank-and-file Democrats complained that their priorities weren’t included in the Senate deal. Pelosi and her team reiterated that they will continue to fight for many of those proposals, noting there will be opportunities in the fourth stimulus bill Congress is all-but certain to craft. House Democrats are expected to be briefed on a full caucus call sometime after the Senate text is unveiled. ""This is not going to be the last bill,"" Pelosi said on PBS. ""This bill is about mitigation for the [economic] damage that is being done. … The next phase will be recovery.""

    AnswerContent:
      '"The 880-page legislation is the largest economic relief bill in U.S. history. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., appeared somber and exhausted as he announced the vote. He released senators from Washington until April 20, though he promised to recall them if needed. ""96-0 in the United States Senate,"" President Trump wrote on Twitter. ""Congratulations AMERICA!"" The unanimous vote came despite misgivings on both sides about whether it goes too far or not far enough. The vote capped days of difficult negotiations as Washington confronted a national challenge unlike any it has ever faced. Unemployment numbers were set to be revealed Thursday morning, and experts warned they could reach alarming new highs. The package would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year, and $2,400 to married couples making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child. After a $75,000 threshold for individuals, the benefit would be reduced by $5 for each $100 the taxpayer makes. A similar $150,000 threshold applies to couples, and a $112,500 threshold for heads of households. The legislation passed by the Senate will use 2019 tax returns, if available, or 2018 tax returns to assess income for determining how much direct financial aid individuals receive. Those who did not file tax returns can use a Form SSA-1099, Social Security Benefit Statement or Form RRB-1099, a Social Security Equivalent Benefit Statement, per Page 149 of the bill. Further, the bill allocates $250 billion to extend unemployment insurance to more workers, and lengthen the duration to 39 weeks, up from the normal 26 weeks. $600 extra a week would be provided for four months. (Just before voting on the final package began late Wednesday, the Senate was debating an amendment from Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., to bar people from getting more from new unemployment benefits than they would have received on the job; the amendment needed 60 votes and failed 48-48.) The final package would additionally provide $349 billion in loans to small businesses -- and money spent on rent, payroll and utilities becomes grants that don\'t need to be paid back. Many hotels would qualify as small businesses under the plan. Passenger airlines would receive $25 billion for workers\' ""salaries and benefits,"" plus up to $25 billion more in loan guarantees and loans. Contract workers would also receive $3 billion in assistance. Airlines would have to agree not to furlough workers until at least the end of September in return. About $17 billion will go to other distressed companies like Boeing, which is seen as essential to national security. And, approximately $200 billion would be provided in tax assistance to small businesses, including through payroll tax deferrals. At the same time, the bill omits many -- though not all -- items from Pelosi\'s version of the legislation that Republicans had called wasteful or irrelevant, including climate-change-related emissions restrictions for airlines and various diversity-related provisions. Gone from the stimulus bill are mentions of mandatory early voting, ballot harvesting, requirements that federal agencies review their usage of ""minority banks,"" and attempts to curb airlines\' carbon emissions -- a Pelosi demand that even Saikat Chakrabarti, the former chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and an author of the Green New Deal, called ""ridiculous."" ""What\'s not in the Senate\'s bipartisan coronavirus bill: Pelosi\'s outrageous wish list,"" wrote GOP national spokesperson Elizabeth Harrington. ""0 mentions of \'diversity.\' 0 mentions of \'emissions.\' 0 mentions of \'early voting.\' 0 mentions of \'climate change.\' Good!"" But, the package still contained some wins for Pelosi. Page 524 of the bill text indicates that many businesses that take a government loan would be obligated to remain neutral in any ""union organizing effort"" during the loan -- a major giveaway to unions. Affected businesses would have between 500 and 10,000 employees. And, Page 781 of the bill provides $25 million to the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives to cover ""salary and expenses."" Also in the final bill text, $25 million would still be allocated for the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Trump, speaking at the White House coronavirus briefing earlier Wednesday, said that he understood the provision was necessary because Democrats demanded some concessions in order to get the stimulus bill passed, even though it galled some conservatives. Pelosi was the first to demand the Kennedy Center money in her own bill, which Republicans said was full of unseemly payouts for well-connected special interests at a time of national crisis. The Kennedy Center put out a statement Wednesday evening saying it was ""extraordinarily grateful that Congress has recognized our institution\'s unique status and has included funding in its legislation to ensure that we can reopen our doors and stages as soon as we are able."" ""For an opera house, you sure are tone-deaf,"" responded blogger Jim Treacher, after telling the Kennedy Center where to shove its statement. Meanwhile, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said the House would vote on the matter on Friday. Republican leaders said they\'d whip votes to support the bill. ""Over the past few days, the Senate has stepped into the breach,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in his own remarks. ""We packed weeks or perhaps months of the legislative process into five days. Representatives from both sides of the aisle and both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue have forged a bipartisan agreement in highly partisan times, with very little time to spare."" He added: ""It’s been a long, hard road, with a remarkable number of twists and turns, but for the sake of millions of Americans, it will be worth it. It will be worth it to get help to millions of small businesses and save tens of millions of jobs."" However, earlier in the day, a senior GOP source told Fox News contributor and Townhall.com editor Guy Benson that the compromise bill was a face-saving exercise by Schumer, and that he was trying to ""take credit"" for a GOP bill that he filibustered for ""small ball"" alterations. Democrats, the source said, couldn\'t drag the situation out much longer; economic conditions have worsened dramatically, and President Trump\'s approval rating has risen. And, a senior Republican aide separately told Fox News: ""I half expected that the next thing I read would be the Minority Leader taking credit for inventing fire. The reality is that almost every significant \'win\' he\'s taking credit for, is actually a Senate Republican idea."" Republicans had ""never objected"" to more hospital funding, or that oversight of the stimulus stabilization fund ""be structured almost exactly like TARP oversight,"" the aide went on. And Republicans were the first to push for three months of unemployment insurance and ""did not oppose adding a fourth."" The stimulus movement came as stocks posted their first back-to-back gains in weeks, but much of Wednesday\'s early rally faded as the hitch developed in the Senate. The market is down nearly 27 percent since setting a record high a month ago. Amid the debate, presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders said he might try to torpedo the Senate\'s stimulus package as Republican senators raised objections about what they called a ""massive drafting error"" related to unemployment benefits. “In my view, it would be an outrage to prevent working-class Americans to receive the emergency unemployment assistance included in this legislation,"" Sanders said in a statement, also posted on social media. Sanders took to the Senate floor late Wednesday at approximately 9:30 p.m. ET to say he was concerned that the administration would be able to ""expend $500 billion in virtually any way they want"" under the legislation. In fact, the administration would not have such unilateral control. ""They\'re very upset that somebody who is making 10, 12 bucks an hour might end up with a paycheck for four months more than they received last week,"" Sanders went on. ""Oh, my god, the universe is collapsing!"" The concern from Sens. Lindsey Graham, Tim Scott, R-S.C., Sasse, and Rick Scott, R-Fla., was that the the bill could pay workers more in unemployment benefits than they\'d make in salary, by sticking a $600 per week payment on top of ordinary benefits that are calculated as a percentage of income. Democrats and economists have countered that the point of the new unemployment benefit is, in fact, to make peoples\' salaries whole, and that companies could simply raise wages to compete and attract workers. ""The weird thing about this hypothetical \'generous unemployment pay will discourage people from entering critical industries\' is... they could just raise wages?"" Alex Godofsky wrote on Twitter. ""Amazon has already raised wages. Like, it\'s okay if wages - and prices - go up for a while. It\'s fine."" Others have noted that the unemployment benefits boost would expire in the summer. In an article entitled ""Republican Senators’ Objection to Expanded Unemployment Benefits Makes Little Sense,"" Josh Barro began by noting that ""these are unemployment benefits, and you generally have to have been laid off to claim them."" ""We will continue to have virus-mitigation measures that create mass unemployment for a significant period, and even after those measures can be relaxed through much of the country, it will take some time for employers to re-ingest all the previously laid-off workers,"" Barro wrote. ""In fact, it’s likely that the shutdowns will persist long enough that the enhanced benefits will need to be extended. If we’re in a situation by July where all the shutdowns are over and employers are eagerly hiring and our biggest concern is too many people don’t want to go back to work, I will be overjoyed and very surprised."" Later Wednesday, the Republicans agreed to drop their objections to fast-tracking the stimulus vote, as long as there was first a vote on the Sasse amendment to cap unemployment benefits to 100 percent of salary. Also in the evening, Pelosi said unanimous consent was a nonstarter in the House, and implied that quick passage in the lower chamber may be unrealistic. Pelosi has called for members to have at least 24 hours to review the bill text once it\'s available. “That’s not gonna work,"" she told reporters shortly after 7:30 p.m. ET, referring to unanimous consent. ""Republicans have told us that’s not possible from their said. ... What I’d like to see -- because this a $2 trillion bill -- I’d like to see a good debate on the floor."" Meanwhile, the White House projected confidence. Insistently optimistic, President Trump said of the greatest public-health emergency in anyone\'s lifetime, ""I don’t think it\'s going to end up being such a rough patch"" and anticipated the economy soaring “like a rocket ship” when it\'s over. Yet he implored Congress late in the day to move on critical aid without further delay. The package is intended as relief for an economy spiraling into recession or worse and a nation facing a grim toll from an infection that\'s killed nearly 20,000 people worldwide. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, asked how long the aid would keep the economy afloat, said: “We’ve anticipated three months. Hopefully, we won’t need this for three months."" Underscoring the effort\'s sheer magnitude, the bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion annual federal budget.

It includes a dramatic expansion of unemployment insurance, a rescue fund for state and local governments, immediate cash for hospitals and a huge pool of grants and loans for small businesses. The House, meanwhile, is expected to take up the bill as early as Thursday evening. Democratic leaders have promised to give members a 24-hour notice before the scheduled vote. And Pelosi and her leadership team spent much of the day on conference calls briefing their members about the plan, even as the bill text was held up in the Senate. It is Congress’ third major bill in response to the crisis, which has infected 55,500 Americans and brought the U.S. economy to a standstill, and will not be the last. ""Today, the Senate will act to help the people of this country weather this storm,” McConnell said in an emotional speech about how the nation would fight and beat the coronavirus crisis. “Our nation needed us to go big and go fast and they did."" ""This is not even a stimulus package — it’s emergency relief,"" McConnell said. Ahead of the bill’s release, Mnuchin huddled with Senate Republicans on a conference call and senators have been given near-final drafts to review. Pelosi had originally hoped to bring the bill up via unanimous consent after Senate passage, a voting method that would not force lawmakers to return to Washington. But she said later Wednesday that House leaders were looking at other options, noting that at least some Republicans were on their way to Capitol Hill to object to the legislation when it moves to the House. Congressional leaders are now hoping to pass the package in the House with a voice vote — similar to unanimous consent in that members aren\'t required to be present but the lawmakers in the chamber can verbally register their opposition or support. The Democratic whip team is also figuring out a process for potential proxy voting, which would require a rule change but would mean fewer members have to return to the Capitol compared to a roll call vote. Still, a single member could object and demand a roll call vote. Pelosi has already advised her members that they may need to return to Washington, telling Democrats Wednesday that House leaders are talking to Capitol Police and the attending physician in preparation. House Republican leaders have privately acknowledged that there\'s a strong possibility that a member will object to a unanimous consent agreement. There has been plenty of last-minute drama with the Senate package. A furious New York Governor Andrew Cuomo held an emergency call with the House’s New York delegation at 11 a.m., where he told them “New York is dead"" and they needed to push for a stronger package, according to people familiar with the call. Cuomo later grew emotional during a press conference, lashing out at the Senate’s bill as “a drop in the bucket” for his state, which now has 30,611 coronavirus cases. Shortly after, Schumer, who represents New York and signed off on the bill, organized his own teleconference for his state’s delegation to help rally support for the bill. Still, Democrats have touted wins in the package, including $130 billion in funding for hospitals; a massive temporary expansion of unemployment benefits; federal oversight of a $500 billion fund to aid distressed industries; and a prohibition on access to loans or investments from the new programs to any of Trump’s personal businesses. Republican aides, however, accused Schumer of exaggerating some of his “wins” and countered that the GOP never objected to more money for hospitals or oversight of the $500 billion fund for corporations. Pelosi and other top Democrats have been fielding questions and complaints from their caucus in a series of calls Wednesday as rank-and-file Democrats complained that their priorities weren’t included in the Senate deal. Pelosi and her team reiterated that they will continue to fight for many of those proposals, noting there will be opportunities in the fourth stimulus bill Congress is all-but certain to craft. House Democrats are expected to be briefed on a full caucus call sometime after the Senate text is unveiled. ""This is not going to be the last bill,"" Pelosi said on PBS. ""This bill is about mitigation for the [economic] damage that is being done. … The next phase will be recovery."" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) blessed the deal in a statement Wednesday afternoon, and later told reporters at a press conference that he prefers a voice vote over a unanimous consent request. Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), who frequently objects to Congress’ biggest spending packages and isn’t beholden to party leadership, has also scoffed at the deal on Twitter, but signaled he won’t hold it up “if they have majorities to pass it.” Marianne LeVine contributed to this report."',
    AnswerContent:
      "\"Senate leaders raced to unravel last-minute snags Wednesday and win passage of an unparalleled $2 trillion economic rescue package steering aid to businesses, workers and health care systems engulfed by the coronavirus pandemic. The measure is the largest economic relief bill in history, and both parties' leaders were desperate for quick passage of a bill aimed at a virus that is costing lives and jobs by the hour. The package is intended as a weekslong or monthslong patch for an economy spiraling into recession or worse and a nation facing a grim toll from an infection that's killed nearly 20,000 people worldwide. Underscoring the effort's sheer magnitude, the bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion annual federal budget. \"\"A fight has arrived on our shores,\"\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \"\"We did not seek it, we did not want it, but now we're going to win it.\"\" \"\"Big help, quick help, is on the way,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. But the drive by leaders to speed the bill through the Senate was slowed as four conservative Republican senators demanded changes, saying the legislation as written “incentivizes layoffs\"\" and should be altered to ensure employees don't earn more money if they're laid off than if they're working. Complicating the standoff, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination has flagged, said he would block the bill unless the conservatives dropped their objections. Other objections floated in from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has become a prominent Democrat on the national scene as the country battles the pandemic. Cuomo, whose state has seen more deaths from the pandemic than any other, said: “I'm telling you, these numbers don't work.\"\" Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said the package “goes a long way.\"\" He said it will require strong oversight to ensure the wealthy don't benefit at the expense of workers and proposed forgiving at least $10,000 of student loan debt as part of the federal response. McConnell and Schumer hoped passage of the legislation in the Republican-led Senate would come by the end of the day. After a banner day on Tuesday as the package took shape, the stock market rallied even more on Wednesday. Senate passage would leave final congressional approval up to the Democratic-controlled House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the bipartisan agreement “takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people” but she stopped short of fully endorsing it. “House Democrats will now review the final provisions and legislative text of the agreement to determine a course of action,” she said. House members are scattered around the country and the timetable for votes in that chamber is unclear. House Democratic and Republican leaders have hoped to clear the measure for President Donald Trump's signature by a voice vote without having to call lawmakers back to Washington. But that may prove challenging, as the bill is sure to be opposed by some conservatives upset at its cost and scope. Ardent liberals were restless as well. White House aide Eric Ueland announced the agreement in a Capitol hallway Wednesday, shortly after midnight, capping days of often intense haggling and mounting pressure. The wording of some final pieces of the agreement need to be completed. The sprawling, 500-page-plus measure is the third coronavirus response bill produced by Congress and by far the largest. It builds on efforts focused on vaccines and emergency response, sick and family medical leave for workers, and food aid. It would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines. Hospitals would get significant help as well. McConnell, a key negotiator, said the package will “rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation's health care fight. And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help Americans workers, families, small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar.\"\" Five days of arduous talks produced the bill, creating tensions among Congress' top leaders, who each took care to tend to party politics as they maneuvered and battled over crafting the legislation. But failure was never an option, which permitted both sides to mark big wins. “That Washington drama does not matter any more,” McConnell said. “The Senate is going to stand together, act together, and pass this historic relief package today.” The bill would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year, and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child A huge cash infusion for hospitals expecting a flood of COVID-19 patients grew during the talks at Schumer's insistence. Republicans pressed for tens of billions of dollars for additional relief to be delivered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the lead federal disaster agency. Democrats said the package would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time. Schumer said businesses controlled by members of Congress and top administration officials — including Trump and his immediate family members — would be ineligible for the bill's business assistance. The New York Democrat immediately sent out a roster of negotiating wins for transit systems, hospital, and cash-hungry state governments that were cemented after Democrats blocked the measure in votes held Sunday and Monday to maneuver for such gains. But Cuomo said the Senate package would send less than $4 billion to New York, far short of his estimate that the crisis will cost his state up to $15 billion over the next year. More than 280 New Yorkers have died from the virus, a death toll more than double that of any other state. Pelosi was a force behind $400 million in grants to states to expand voting by mail and other steps that Democrats billed as making voting safer but Republican critics said was political opportunism. The package also contains $15.5 billion more for a surge in demand for food stamps. Republicans won inclusion of an “employee retention” tax credit that's estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50% of workers' paychecks. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax. A companion appropriations package ballooned as well, growing from a $46 billion White House proposal to more than $300 billion, which dwarfs earlier disasters — including Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy combined. To provide transparency, the package is expected to create a new inspector general and oversight board for the corporate dollars, much as was done during the 2008 bank rescue, officials said. Europe is enacting its own economic recovery packages, with huge amounts of credit guarantees, government spending and other support. Germany alone, Europe's biggest economy, has agreed to commit over 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion) in fiscal stimulus and support — roughly 30 percent of that nation's entire annual output. France, Spain and Italy have launched similar programs. The European Union has suspended limits it imposes on member countries' borrowing and deficits, freeing them to spend more. Some of Europe's fiscal stimulus kicks in automatically without any new legislation due to social welfare safety nets that are more extensive than in the U.S. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death. In the United States, more than 55,000 people have been sickened and more than 800 have died. \"",

The Democratic whip team is also figuring out a process for potential proxy voting, which would require a rule change but would mean fewer members have to return to the Capitol compared to a roll call vote. Still, a single member could object and demand a roll call vote. Pelosi has already advised her members that they may need to return to Washington, telling Democrats Wednesday that House leaders are talking to Capitol Police and the attending physician in preparation. House Republican leaders have privately acknowledged that there\'s a strong possibility that a member will object to a unanimous consent agreement. There has been plenty of last-minute drama with the Senate package. A furious New York Governor Andrew Cuomo held an emergency call with the House’s New York delegation at 11 a.m., where he told them “New York is dead"" and they needed to push for a stronger package, according to people familiar with the call. Cuomo later grew emotional during a press conference, lashing out at the Senate’s bill as “a drop in the bucket” for his state, which now has 30,611 coronavirus cases. Shortly after, Schumer, who represents New York and signed off on the bill, organized his own teleconference for his state’s delegation to help rally support for the bill. Still, Democrats have touted wins in the package, including $130 billion in funding for hospitals; a massive temporary expansion of unemployment benefits; federal oversight of a $500 billion fund to aid distressed industries; and a prohibition on access to loans or investments from the new programs to any of Trump’s personal businesses. Republican aides, however, accused Schumer of exaggerating some of his “wins” and countered that the GOP never objected to more money for hospitals or oversight of the $500 billion fund for corporations. Pelosi and other top Democrats have been fielding questions and complaints from their caucus in a series of calls Wednesday as rank-and-file Democrats complained that their priorities weren’t included in the Senate deal. Pelosi and her team reiterated that they will continue to fight for many of those proposals, noting there will be opportunities in the fourth stimulus bill Congress is all-but certain to craft. House Democrats are expected to be briefed on a full caucus call sometime after the Senate text is unveiled. ""This is not going to be the last bill,"" Pelosi said on PBS. ""This bill is about mitigation for the [economic] damage that is being done. … The next phase will be recovery."" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) blessed the deal in a statement Wednesday afternoon, and later told reporters at a press conference that he prefers a voice vote over a unanimous consent request. Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), who frequently objects to Congress’ biggest spending packages and isn’t beholden to party leadership, has also scoffed at the deal on Twitter, but signaled he won’t hold it up “if they have majorities to pass it.” Marianne LeVine contributed to this report."',
    AnswerContent:
      "\"Senate leaders raced to unravel last-minute snags Wednesday and win passage of an unparalleled $2 trillion economic rescue package steering aid to businesses, workers and health care systems engulfed by the coronavirus pandemic. The measure is the largest economic relief bill in history, and both parties' leaders were desperate for quick passage of a bill aimed at a virus that is costing lives and jobs by the hour. The package is intended as a weekslong or monthslong patch for an economy spiraling into recession or worse and a nation facing a grim toll from an infection that's killed nearly 20,000 people worldwide. Underscoring the effort's sheer magnitude, the bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion annual federal budget. \"\"A fight has arrived on our shores,\"\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \"\"We did not seek it, we did not want it, but now we're going to win it.\"\" \"\"Big help, quick help, is on the way,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. But the drive by leaders to speed the bill through the Senate was slowed as four conservative Republican senators demanded changes, saying the legislation as written “incentivizes layoffs\"\" and should be altered to ensure employees don't earn more money if they're laid off than if they're working. Complicating the standoff, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination has flagged, said he would block the bill unless the conservatives dropped their objections. Other objections floated in from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has become a prominent Democrat on the national scene as the country battles the pandemic. Cuomo, whose state has seen more deaths from the pandemic than any other, said: “I'm telling you, these numbers don't work.\"\" Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said the package “goes a long way.\"\" He said it will require strong oversight to ensure the wealthy don't benefit at the expense of workers and proposed forgiving at least $10,000 of student loan debt as part of the federal response. McConnell and Schumer hoped passage of the legislation in the Republican-led Senate would come by the end of the day. After a banner day on Tuesday as the package took shape, the stock market rallied even more on Wednesday. Senate passage would leave final congressional approval up to the Democratic-controlled House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the bipartisan agreement “takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people” but she stopped short of fully endorsing it. “House Democrats will now review the final provisions and legislative text of the agreement to determine a course of action,” she said. House members are scattered around the country and the timetable for votes in that chamber is unclear. House Democratic and Republican leaders have hoped to clear the measure for President Donald Trump's signature by a voice vote without having to call lawmakers back to Washington. But that may prove challenging, as the bill is sure to be opposed by some conservatives upset at its cost and scope. Ardent liberals were restless as well. White House aide Eric Ueland announced the agreement in a Capitol hallway Wednesday, shortly after midnight, capping days of often intense haggling and mounting pressure. The wording of some final pieces of the agreement need to be completed. The sprawling, 500-page-plus measure is the third coronavirus response bill produced by Congress and by far the largest. It builds on efforts focused on vaccines and emergency response, sick and family medical leave for workers, and food aid. It would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines. Hospitals would get significant help as well. McConnell, a key negotiator, said the package will “rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation's health care fight. And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help Americans workers, families, small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar.\"\" Five days of arduous talks produced the bill, creating tensions among Congress' top leaders, who each took care to tend to party politics as they maneuvered and battled over crafting the legislation. But failure was never an option, which permitted both sides to mark big wins. “That Washington drama does not matter any more,” McConnell said. “The Senate is going to stand together, act together, and pass this historic relief package today.” The bill would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year, and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child A huge cash infusion for hospitals expecting a flood of COVID-19 patients grew during the talks at Schumer's insistence. Republicans pressed for tens of billions of dollars for additional relief to be delivered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the lead federal disaster agency. Democrats said the package would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time. Schumer said businesses controlled by members of Congress and top administration officials — including Trump and his immediate family members — would be ineligible for the bill's business assistance. The New York Democrat immediately sent out a roster of negotiating wins for transit systems, hospital, and cash-hungry state governments that were cemented after Democrats blocked the measure in votes held Sunday and Monday to maneuver for such gains. But Cuomo said the Senate package would send less than $4 billion to New York, far short of his estimate that the crisis will cost his state up to $15 billion over the next year. More than 280 New Yorkers have died from the virus, a death toll more than double that of any other state. Pelosi was a force behind $400 million in grants to states to expand voting by mail and other steps that Democrats billed as making voting safer but Republican critics said was political opportunism. The package also contains $15.5 billion more for a surge in demand for food stamps. Republicans won inclusion of an “employee retention” tax credit that's estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50% of workers' paychecks. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax. A companion appropriations package ballooned as well, growing from a $46 billion White House proposal to more than $300 billion, which dwarfs earlier disasters — including Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy combined. To provide transparency, the package is expected to create a new inspector general and oversight board for the corporate dollars, much as was done during the 2008 bank rescue, officials said. Europe is enacting its own economic recovery packages, with huge amounts of credit guarantees, government spending and other support. Germany alone, Europe's biggest economy, has agreed to commit over 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion) in fiscal stimulus and support — roughly 30 percent of that nation's entire annual output. France, Spain and Italy have launched similar programs. The European Union has suspended limits it imposes on member countries' borrowing and deficits, freeing them to spend more. Some of Europe's fiscal stimulus kicks in automatically without any new legislation due to social welfare safety nets that are more extensive than in the U.S. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death. In the United States, more than 55,000 people have been sickened and more than 800 have died. \"",

      "\"In some parts of the U.S., authorities say gun shops aren’t essential businesses and should close during stay-at-home orders meant to slow the coronavirus. In other places, officials are stopping background checks for concealed carry permits. Elsewhere, city leaders have invoked emergency powers allowing bans on gun sales. As the nation grapples with a pandemic that has upended daily life, some gun rights advocates are concerned about an erosion of Second Amendment rights just as Americans are buying firearms in record numbers to try to ensure their safety. “When there’s a national emergency, people are looking for food, water, shelter - that part is important to the survival of our nation,” said Michael Cargill, owner of Central Texas Gun Works in Austin. “They are also looking for the Second Amendment to protect their families.” TOP STORIES Lawmakers racing back to D.C. to vote on $2.2T coronavirus rescue plan after lone Republican objects 'Directly and very forcefully': Canada tells Trump not to send troops to border British PM Boris Johnson tests positive for coronavirus He’s scaled back how long he’s open each day but said he won’t close his shop and doesn’t believe he should be forced to. In recent weeks, firearm sales have skyrocketed. Background checks - the key barometer of gun sales - already were at record numbers in January and February, likely fueled by a presidential election year. Since the coronavirus outbreak, gun shops have reported long lines and runs on firearms and ammunition. Background checks were up 300 percent on March 16 compared with the same date a year ago, according to federal data shared with the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents gunmakers. Since Feb. 23, each day has seen roughly double the volume over 2019, according to Mark Oliva, spokesman for the group. “When people aren’t able to provide for their own security or their own safety, they’re going to take measures to make sure that they can. That’s why we have that Second Amendment,” Oliva said. “This is a public safety issue.” The federal background check system has been overwhelmed by the massive increase in firearm sales. What might normally take a few minutes is taking much longer, and a backlog on background checks has ballooned to about 80,000, Oliva said. If a background check takes longer than three business days, gun dealers are permitted to allow the sale to go through unless a state has stricter waiting periods. But the National Shooting Sports Foundation has advised gun dealers not to feel beholden to complete the sale if they have concerns about the potential buyer. “We are cautioning retailers that they may want to exercise patience and prudence,” Oliva said. Even some gun control advocates say it might not be wise to shut down federally licensed firearms dealers, whose sales require background checks. That could force buyers to use a website or seek a private sale that doesn’t require a check, making it more difficult to trace a firearm if it’s used in a crime. There are risks to both closing a gun shop or keeping it open, said David Chipman, a retired agent with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. “If you keep it open, there’s the risk of first-time buyers who are largely buying out of fear and panic and untrained,” said Chipman, now senior policy adviser for Giffords, a gun control advocacy group. Gun control advocates are concerned about a large number of new owners lacking the usual access to training on how to store and handle their weapon properly. They also worry that Americans who are stocking up now eventually will sell their firearms privately. “If we can imagine how horrible this crisis is … the people who hoarded the guns might decide six months from now - once they see no zombies around but they’ve run out of tuna and beef jerky - that they need the money to buy food,” Chipman said. In a number of U.S. cities, including New Orleans, the mayor has issued an emergency proclamation that declares the authority to restrict sales of firearms and ammunition. In some states that have ordered people to stay home, gun stores were not among the businesses deemed essential and allowed to stay open, like grocery stores. That has led to confusion in California, where for the second time this week, Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva ordered gun shops to close, challenging a finding by the legal counsel for the nation’s most populous county that the stores are essential businesses. David Prince, owner of Eagle Gun Range in Farmers Branch, Texas, near Dallas, had to temporarily close his store under Dallas County’s stay-at-home order, then was allowed to reopen Wednesday when gun stores were reclassified as essential. Prince said gun stores are critical because they give people the chance to defend themselves. “I always knew people were going to want to protect themselves. What I was concerned about was the look in their faces, they are covered in fear,” Prince said. “If I give them the ability to have a firearm, it gives them a fighting chance to defend their family.” The range that is part of his store is considered nonessential and has been forced to close, meaning new gun buyers can’t use it to train on how to handle their firearm. \"",

      '"Gun sales have stopped in several Texas counties that have deemed gun stores as non-essential businesses during COVID-19 local emergency declarations, but some shops are still open and most continue selling firearms online. Tarrant County officials issued an order Saturday to close down all non-essential businesses to the public. The essential business summary did not include gun shops, but Tarrant County Judge Glen Whitley said they can continue to sell guns as long as they process the orders offsite and customers only show up to pick up their merchandise. “We’re not treating gun shops any different than other retail stores,” said Whitley, “They can order online, they can go in, they can go to the front desk, pay for it and leave.” Dan Boykin, owner of Advantage Firearms in northeast Fort Worth, said he closed after reading about the essential business summary on a news outlet Monday. He’s been taking orders online but said the waiting period for distributors that fill those orders has gone from one day to nearly two weeks. Academy Sports and Outdoors in Fort Worth was closed Wednesday morning and they were not taking online orders, according to their employees, who were instructed to stop all gun sales. One store manager said orders made online were being canceled once they were received at their store and customers who made their orders before the ban would have to wait until after the ban was lifted to pick up their orders. In some neighboring counties also with declarations of local disaster and shelter-at-home orders, gun shops haven’t closed to the public. Parker County issued a public health emergency Monday that did not include gun stores as essential businesses, but some stores kept their doors open. “I don’t think there is any crisis big enough to take away people’s Second Amendment right,” said Austin Kincaid, store manager at SOS Arms in Weatherford. Jose Gonzalez, a phone broker at Uncle Dan’s Pawn in South Dallas, said they were an essential business and had nearly sold out of guns Wednesday morning. Most counties in Texas including Dallas have hardware stores, which include pawn shops, in their list of essential retail. Judge Whitley in Tarrant County said that if a store falls under the essential list but sells other items, including guns, they can continue to open to the public and sell any item in the store. At least 18 counties had issued stay-at-home orders as of Wednesday. Gun shops were closed in the cities of Austin, Waco and Lubbock, and Tarrant, Dallas, Travis and Bexar counties, according to the Texas State Rifle Association. In a recent email to their members, the association argued that banning the sale of guns could be a violation of the state firearms preemption law. “During an emergency, food, water, shelter and adequate medical care are paramount for survival, but so too is the ability of an individual to protect his or herself, as well as their family, home, business and property,” reads the letter. State Representative Dustin Burrows (R-Lubbock), Chairman of the Texas House Committee on Ways & Means, formally requested an opinion Monday from Attorney General Ken Paxton on whether cities or counties can prohibit the sale of firearms. Burrows’ letter claims that Texas’ state firearms preemption law restricts city and county officials from regulating the sale and transfer of firearms even during a natural disaster. "',

      "\"In some parts of the U.S., authorities say gun shops aren’t essential businesses and should close during stay-at-home orders meant to slow the coronavirus. In other places, officials are stopping background checks for concealed carry permits. Elsewhere, city leaders have invoked emergency powers allowing bans on gun sales. As the nation grapples with a pandemic that has upended daily life, some gun rights advocates are concerned about an erosion of Second Amendment rights just as Americans are buying firearms in record numbers to try to ensure their safety. “When there’s a national emergency, people are looking for food, water, shelter - that part is important to the survival of our nation,” said Michael Cargill, owner of Central Texas Gun Works in Austin. “They are also looking for the Second Amendment to protect their families.” TOP STORIES Lawmakers racing back to D.C. to vote on $2.2T coronavirus rescue plan after lone Republican objects 'Directly and very forcefully': Canada tells Trump not to send troops to border British PM Boris Johnson tests positive for coronavirus He’s scaled back how long he’s open each day but said he won’t close his shop and doesn’t believe he should be forced to. In recent weeks, firearm sales have skyrocketed. Background checks - the key barometer of gun sales - already were at record numbers in January and February, likely fueled by a presidential election year. Since the coronavirus outbreak, gun shops have reported long lines and runs on firearms and ammunition. Background checks were up 300 percent on March 16 compared with the same date a year ago, according to federal data shared with the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents gunmakers.

That’s why we have that Second Amendment,” Oliva said. “This is a public safety issue.” The federal background check system has been overwhelmed by the massive increase in firearm sales. What might normally take a few minutes is taking much longer, and a backlog on background checks has ballooned to about 80,000, Oliva said. If a background check takes longer than three business days, gun dealers are permitted to allow the sale to go through unless a state has stricter waiting periods. But the National Shooting Sports Foundation has advised gun dealers not to feel beholden to complete the sale if they have concerns about the potential buyer. “We are cautioning retailers that they may want to exercise patience and prudence,” Oliva said. Even some gun control advocates say it might not be wise to shut down federally licensed firearms dealers, whose sales require background checks. That could force buyers to use a website or seek a private sale that doesn’t require a check, making it more difficult to trace a firearm if it’s used in a crime. There are risks to both closing a gun shop or keeping it open, said David Chipman, a retired agent with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. “If you keep it open, there’s the risk of first-time buyers who are largely buying out of fear and panic and untrained,” said Chipman, now senior policy adviser for Giffords, a gun control advocacy group. Gun control advocates are concerned about a large number of new owners lacking the usual access to training on how to store and handle their weapon properly. They also worry that Americans who are stocking up now eventually will sell their firearms privately. “If we can imagine how horrible this crisis is … the people who hoarded the guns might decide six months from now - once they see no zombies around but they’ve run out of tuna and beef jerky - that they need the money to buy food,” Chipman said.

David Prince, owner of Eagle Gun Range in Farmers Branch, Texas, near Dallas, had to temporarily close his store under Dallas County’s stay-at-home order, then was allowed to reopen Wednesday when gun stores were reclassified as essential. Prince said gun stores are critical because they give people the chance to defend themselves. “I always knew people were going to want to protect themselves. What I was concerned about was the look in their faces, they are covered in fear,” Prince said. “If I give them the ability to have a firearm, it gives them a fighting chance to defend their family.” The range that is part of his store is considered nonessential and has been forced to close, meaning new gun buyers can’t use it to train on how to handle their firearm. \"",

      '"Shares skidded early Friday in Europe after a mixed day in Asia, where Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 jumped while Australia’s benchmark sank 5%. U.S. futures also were lower after major Wall Street indexes jumped more than 6% overnight, bringing the S&P 500 up 17% since Monday as a massive coronavirus relief package for the staggering U.S. economy headed for congressional approval on Friday. Investors had appeared to shrug off miserable news on unemployment following a report that nearly 3.3 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, shattering the prior record set in 1982, as layoffs and business shutdowns sweep across the country. Germany’s DAX fell 1.2% to 9,880.44 while the CAC 40 in Paris gave up 2% to 4,453.30. Britain’s FTSE 100 sank 4% to 5,581.51. The future contract for the S&P 500 fell 1.6% to 2,567.60. The future for the Dow industrials lost 1.5% to 22,017.00. “Rallies don’t last forever and clearly investors are happy to call time on this one as we head into another uncertain weekend,” Craig Erlam of Oanda said in a report. “We may have had a good run this week but the weekend can feel like a long time at moments like this and the numbers we’re getting from the U.S., which now has more cases than China or Italy, are getting uglier by the day,” he said. Thursday’s bad news on unemployment was expected and followed earlier gains after Congress and the Federal Reserve promised an astonishing amount of aid for the economy and markets, hoping to support them as the outbreak causes more businesses to shut down by the day. The $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief plan due to be voted on by the House of Representatives on Friday includes direct payments to U.S. households and aid to hard-hit industries. The prospect of a big financial shot in the arm for businesses and households helped offset some of the concerns about the steep job losses the economy is beginning to see due to the coronavirus. But barring unexpected good news, it’s a matter of time before this stimulus-fueled rally fades, analysts said. With the U.S. stimulus bill about a tenth the size of the U.S. economy, “it remains difficult to imagine what this could do in the longer term in terms of restoring confidence once again without a material improvement of the coronavirus landscape,” Jingyi Pan of IG said in a commentary. Still, Asian markets mostly rose as governments tightened controls on businesses and travel, seeking to contain the pandemic. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index surged 3.9% to 19,389.43, while South Korea’s Kospi jumped 1.9% to 1,717.73. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong advanced 0.6% to 23,484.28, while the Shanghai Composite index edged 0.3% higher to 2,772.20. Shares fell in Taiwan but rose in Southeast Asia. India’s Sensex rebounded, gaining 0.7% to 30,148.36 after the central bank slashed its key lending rate to a decade-low 4.4% from 5.15% to help the economy weather a lockdown aimed at beating the outbreak in the world’s second most populous country. Sydney’s S&P/ASX 200 slipped to 4,842.40. So far, though, there’s no been reassurance on the spread of the pandemic. The United States has reported more than 85,000 known cases, and the worldwide number of infections has topped a half-million, according to Johns Hopkins University. The death toll has climbed to more than 24,000, while more than 120,000 have recovered. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. Despite strong rallies this week, analysts say further big drops are to be expected until there have been enough sustained gains in the market, and progress in fighting the pandemic, to ease investors’ fear of further declines. In other trading, benchmark U.S. oil was steady, gaining 20 cents to $22.80 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It slid 7.7% on Thursday to settle at $22.60 a barrel. Goldman Sachs has forecast that it will fall well below $20 a barrel in the next two months because storage will be filled to the brim and wells will have to be shut in. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 1 cent to $28.64 per barrel. The dollar fell to 108.82 Japanese yen from 109.62 yen late Thursday. The euro weakened to $1.1020 from $1.1024. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 0.78% from 0.83% late Thursday. It had been as low as 0.77% just before the jobless report was released. Lower yields reflect dimmer expectations for economic growth and greater demand for low-risk assets. "',

      '"Johannesburg (AFP) - South Africa recorded its first two deaths from the novel coronavirus on Friday as the number of confirmed cases breached the 1,000 mark just hours after a three-week nationwide lockdown swung into action. ""This morning we wake South Africans up with sad news that we now have our first deaths resulting from COVID-19,"" Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said in a statement. President Cyril Ramaphosa has ordered the 57-strong population of Africa\'s most industrialised nation to stay at home for 21 days, joining other countries across the continent which have imposed strict measures to halt the spread of the disease. But many people defied the order which came into effect at midnight Thursday, lining up outside food stores or at bus terminals. Police appeared overwhelmed in downtown Johannesburg on Friday where hundreds of shoppers pushed and shoved trying to force their way into a supermarket. ""The lockdown is a good thing for the country, even though I feel that a lot of people and taking it for granted, saying this virus is not for us... which is bad because by the time we wake up this thing will have spread enormously in the country,"" said bank employee Dumisani July, 39, wearing a mask and black latex gloves. Mkhize said the two people died in the Western Cape province, and announced that the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases have topped 1,000. On Thursday, the country had reported 927 confirmed cases, a jump of more than 30 percent from the previous day, with Ramaphosa projecting it could reach 1,500 ""within a few days"". Kenya, Rwanda and Mali are some of the African countries that have imposed restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus, which has been confirmed to have infected more than 3,200 people and killed 89 across the continent. Although Africa\'s toll is far lower than in Europe, the United States and the Middle East, health experts say the world\'s poorest continent is especially vulnerable and the figures likely fall far short of the reality. Donning a camouflage uniform complete with a cap, Ramaphosa on Thursday saw off soldiers before they deployed from a military base in Soweto township outside economic hub Johannesburg. ""This is unprecedented, not only in our democracy but also in the history of our country, that we will have a lockdown for 21 days to go out and wage war against an invisible enemy coronavirus,"" he said. During the shutdown, jogging, dog-walking and the sale of alcohol are banned across the country, which so far has the highest number of detected infections in sub-Saharan Africa. Violation of any of the regulations will carry a six-month jail sentence or a fine. In West Africa, Nigeria\'s government warned Thursday that Africa\'s most populous nation could soon see an ""exponential"" increase in infections unless contacts of confirmed cases are tracked down more rapidly. - \'War against invisible enemy\' - Kenya, which has 31 cases, on Thursday recorded its first death -- a 66-year-old Kenyan man who had travelled from South Africa on March 13. The east African country will begin a night-time curfew on Friday to try curtail the spread. In the Sahel, Burkina Faso, which last week recorded sub-Saharan Africa\'s first death, announced that eight towns, including the capital Ouagadougou, would be quarantined from Friday. ""Quarantined means that nobody will enter or leave the towns involved,"" Communication Minister Remis Fulgance Dandjinou said, adding that the measure would be applied for two weeks. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, authorities ordered a four-day ""total confinement"" in the capital Kinshasa starting Saturday. Moody\'s Investors Service warned that the fallout from the border closures, commodity price declines and financial market volatility will have ""severe macroeconomic and financial impact"" on African sovereign debt."',
