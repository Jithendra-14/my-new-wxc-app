        AnswerContent: '"BANGKOK (AP) — Shares skidded early Friday in Europe after a mixed day in Asia, where Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 jumped while Australia’s benchmark sank 5%. U.S. futures also were lower after major Wall Street indexes jumped more than 6% overnight, bringing the S&P 500 up 17% since Monday as a massive coronavirus relief package for the staggering U.S. economy headed for congressional approval on Friday. Investors had appeared to shrug off miserable news on unemployment following a report that nearly 3.3 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, shattering the prior record set in 1982, as layoffs and business shutdowns sweep across the country. Germany’s DAX fell 1.2% to 9,880.44 while the CAC 40 in Paris gave up 2% to 4,453.30. Britain’s FTSE 100 sank 4% to 5,581.51. The future contract for the S&P 500 fell 1.6% to 2,567.60. The future for the Dow industrials lost 1.5% to 22,017.00. “Rallies don’t last forever and clearly investors are happy to call time on this one as we head into another uncertain weekend,” Craig Erlam of Oanda said in a report. “We may have had a good run this week but the weekend can feel like a long time at moments like this and the numbers we’re getting from the U.S., which now has more cases than China or Italy, are getting uglier by the day,” he said. Thursday’s bad news on unemployment was expected and followed earlier gains after Congress and the Federal Reserve promised an astonishing amount of aid for the economy and markets, hoping to support them as the outbreak causes more businesses to shut down by the day. The $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief plan due to be voted on by the House of Representatives on Friday includes direct payments to U.S. households and aid to hard-hit industries. The prospect of a big financial shot in the arm for businesses and households helped offset some of the concerns about the steep job losses the economy is beginning to see due to the coronavirus. But barring unexpected good news, it’s a matter of time before this stimulus-fueled rally fades, analysts said. With the U.S. stimulus bill about a tenth the size of the U.S. economy, “it remains difficult to imagine what this could do in the longer term in terms of restoring confidence once again without a material improvement of the coronavirus landscape,” Jingyi Pan of IG said in a commentary. Still, Asian markets mostly rose as governments tightened controls on businesses and travel, seeking to contain the pandemic. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index surged 3.9% to 19,389.43, while South Korea’s Kospi jumped 1.9% to 1,717.73. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong advanced 0.6% to 23,484.28, while the Shanghai Composite index edged 0.3% higher to 2,772.20. Shares fell in Taiwan but rose in Southeast Asia. India’s Sensex rebounded, gaining 0.7% to 30,148.36 after the central bank slashed its key lending rate to a decade-low 4.4% from 5.15% to help the economy weather a lockdown aimed at beating the outbreak in the world’s second most populous country. Sydney’s S&P/ASX 200 slipped to 4,842.40. So far, though, there’s no been reassurance on the spread of the pandemic. The United States has reported more than 85,000 known cases, and the worldwide number of infections has topped a half-million, according to Johns Hopkins University. The death toll has climbed to more than 24,000, while more than 120,000 have recovered. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. Despite strong rallies this week, analysts say further big drops are to be expected until there have been enough sustained gains in the market, and progress in fighting the pandemic, to ease investors’ fear of further declines. In other trading, benchmark U.S. oil was steady, gaining 20 cents to $22.80 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It slid 7.7% on Thursday to settle at $22.60 a barrel. Goldman Sachs has forecast that it will fall well below $20 a barrel in the next two months because storage will be filled to the brim and wells will have to be shut in. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 1 cent to $28.64 per barrel. The dollar fell to 108.82 Japanese yen from 109.62 yen late Thursday. The euro weakened to $1.1020 from $1.1024. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 0.78% from 0.83% late Thursday. It had been as low as 0.77% just before the jobless report was released. Lower yields reflect dimmer expectations for economic growth and greater demand for low-risk assets. "',

        ArticleContent: '"The Senate is on track to pass a mammoth $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package Wednesday evening after leaders agreed to an amendment vote aimed at appeasing a small group of GOP senators, overcoming a last-minute hurdle that had delayed quick passage of the bipartisan deal. At issue is language surrounding beefed-up unemployment insurance, which they say would allow workers to be paid more on unemployment than what they were making while employed. To mollify those concerns, leaders have agreed to allow an amendment vote on the floor, according to sources familiar with the matter. After that vote — which is expected to fail — senators can turn to final passage, sending it over to the House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi chided the GOP quartet for holding up the historic package, especially since it has bipartisan support from congressional leaders and the White House. ""We’re talking about $600,"" Pelosi said in an interview on ""PBS NewsHour"" Wednesday evening. ""People are scared, they’re in need, they have additional expenses. I don’t need to explain that to you."" The emergency package, the largest of its kind in U.S. history, comes after five days of tense negotiations between Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. It includes a dramatic expansion of unemployment insurance, a rescue fund for state and local governments, immediate cash for hospitals and a huge pool of grants and loans for small businesses. The House, meanwhile, is expected to take up the bill as early as Thursday evening. Democratic leaders have promised to give members a 24-hour notice before the scheduled vote. And Pelosi and her leadership team spent much of the day on conference calls briefing their members about the plan, even as the bill text was held up in the Senate. It is Congress’ third major bill in response to the crisis, which has infected 55,500 Americans and brought the U.S. economy to a standstill, and will not be the last. ""Today, the Senate will act to help the people of this country weather this storm,” McConnell said in an emotional speech about how the nation would fight and beat the coronavirus crisis. “Our nation needed us to go big and go fast and they did."" ""This is not even a stimulus package — it’s emergency relief,"" McConnell said. Ahead of the bill’s release, Mnuchin huddled with Senate Republicans on a conference call and senators have been given near-final drafts to review. Pelosi had originally hoped to bring the bill up via unanimous consent after Senate passage, a voting method that would not force lawmakers to return to Washington. But she said later Wednesday that House leaders were looking at other options, noting that at least some Republicans were on their way to Capitol Hill to object to the legislation when it moves to the House. Congressional leaders are now hoping to pass the package in the House with a voice vote — similar to unanimous consent in that members aren\'t required to be present but the lawmakers in the chamber can verbally register their opposition or support. The Democratic whip team is also figuring out a process for potential proxy voting, which would require a rule change but would mean fewer members have to return to the Capitol compared to a roll call vote. Still, a single member could object and demand a roll call vote. Pelosi has already advised her members that they may need to return to Washington, telling Democrats Wednesday that House leaders are talking to Capitol Police and the attending physician in preparation. House Republican leaders have privately acknowledged that there\'s a strong possibility that a member will object to a unanimous consent agreement. There has been plenty of last-minute drama with the Senate package. A furious New York Governor Andrew Cuomo held an emergency call with the House’s New York delegation at 11 a.m., where he told them “New York is dead"" and they needed to push for a stronger package, according to people familiar with the call. Cuomo later grew emotional during a press conference, lashing out at the Senate’s bill as “a drop in the bucket” for his state, which now has 30,611 coronavirus cases. Shortly after, Schumer, who represents New York and signed off on the bill, organized his own teleconference for his state’s delegation to help rally support for the bill. Still, Democrats have touted wins in the package, including $130 billion in funding for hospitals; a massive temporary expansion of unemployment benefits; federal oversight of a $500 billion fund to aid distressed industries; and a prohibition on access to loans or investments from the new programs to any of Trump’s personal businesses. Republican aides, however, accused Schumer of exaggerating some of his “wins” and countered that the GOP never objected to more money for hospitals or oversight of the $500 billion fund for corporations. Pelosi and other top Democrats have been fielding questions and complaints from their caucus in a series of calls Wednesday as rank-and-file Democrats complained that their priorities weren’t included in the Senate deal. Pelosi and her team reiterated that they will continue to fight for many of those proposals, noting there will be opportunities in the fourth stimulus bill Congress is all-but certain to craft. House Democrats are expected to be briefed on a full caucus call sometime after the Senate text is unveiled. ""This is not going to be the last bill,"" Pelosi said on PBS. ""This bill is about mitigation for the [economic] damage that is being done. … The next phase will be recovery."" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) blessed the deal in a statement Wednesday afternoon, and later told reporters at a press conference that he prefers a voice vote over a unanimous consent request. Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), who frequently objects to Congress’ biggest spending packages and isn’t beholden to party leadership, has also scoffed at the deal on Twitter, but signaled he won’t hold it up “if they have majorities to pass it.” Marianne LeVine contributed to this report."',
        AnswerContent: "\"WASHINGTON -- Senate leaders raced to unravel last-minute snags Wednesday and win passage of an unparalleled $2 trillion economic rescue package steering aid to businesses, workers and health care systems engulfed by the coronavirus pandemic. The measure is the largest economic relief bill in history, and both parties' leaders were desperate for quick passage of a bill aimed at a virus that is costing lives and jobs by the hour. The package is intended as a weekslong or monthslong patch for an economy spiraling into recession or worse and a nation facing a grim toll from an infection that's killed nearly 20,000 people worldwide. Underscoring the effort's sheer magnitude, the bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion annual federal budget. \"\"A fight has arrived on our shores,\"\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \"\"We did not seek it, we did not want it, but now we're going to win it.\"\" \"\"Big help, quick help, is on the way,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. But the drive by leaders to speed the bill through the Senate was slowed as four conservative Republican senators demanded changes, saying the legislation as written “incentivizes layoffs\"\" and should be altered to ensure employees don't earn more money if they're laid off than if they're working. Complicating the standoff, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination has flagged, said he would block the bill unless the conservatives dropped their objections. Other objections floated in from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has become a prominent Democrat on the national scene as the country battles the pandemic. Cuomo, whose state has seen more deaths from the pandemic than any other, said: “I'm telling you, these numbers don't work.\"\" Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said the package “goes a long way.\"\" He said it will require strong oversight to ensure the wealthy don't benefit at the expense of workers and proposed forgiving at least $10,000 of student loan debt as part of the federal response. McConnell and Schumer hoped passage of the legislation in the Republican-led Senate would come by the end of the day. After a banner day on Tuesday as the package took shape, the stock market rallied even more on Wednesday. Senate passage would leave final congressional approval up to the Democratic-controlled House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the bipartisan agreement “takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people” but she stopped short of fully endorsing it. “House Democrats will now review the final provisions and legislative text of the agreement to determine a course of action,” she said. House members are scattered around the country and the timetable for votes in that chamber is unclear. House Democratic and Republican leaders have hoped to clear the measure for President Donald Trump's signature by a voice vote without having to call lawmakers back to Washington. But that may prove challenging, as the bill is sure to be opposed by some conservatives upset at its cost and scope. Ardent liberals were restless as well. White House aide Eric Ueland announced the agreement in a Capitol hallway Wednesday, shortly after midnight, capping days of often intense haggling and mounting pressure. The wording of some final pieces of the agreement need to be completed. The sprawling, 500-page-plus measure is the third coronavirus response bill produced by Congress and by far the largest. It builds on efforts focused on vaccines and emergency response, sick and family medical leave for workers, and food aid. It would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines. Hospitals would get significant help as well. McConnell, a key negotiator, said the package will “rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation's health care fight. And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help Americans workers, families, small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar.\"\" Five days of arduous talks produced the bill, creating tensions among Congress' top leaders, who each took care to tend to party politics as they maneuvered and battled over crafting the legislation. But failure was never an option, which permitted both sides to mark big wins. “That Washington drama does not matter any more,” McConnell said. “The Senate is going to stand together, act together, and pass this historic relief package today.” The bill would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year, and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child A huge cash infusion for hospitals expecting a flood of COVID-19 patients grew during the talks at Schumer's insistence. Republicans pressed for tens of billions of dollars for additional relief to be delivered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the lead federal disaster agency. Democrats said the package would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time. Schumer said businesses controlled by members of Congress and top administration officials — including Trump and his immediate family members — would be ineligible for the bill's business assistance. The New York Democrat immediately sent out a roster of negotiating wins for transit systems, hospital, and cash-hungry state governments that were cemented after Democrats blocked the measure in votes held Sunday and Monday to maneuver for such gains. But Cuomo said the Senate package would send less than $4 billion to New York, far short of his estimate that the crisis will cost his state up to $15 billion over the next year. More than 280 New Yorkers have died from the virus, a death toll more than double that of any other state. Pelosi was a force behind $400 million in grants to states to expand voting by mail and other steps that Democrats billed as making voting safer but Republican critics said was political opportunism. The package also contains $15.5 billion more for a surge in demand for food stamps. Republicans won inclusion of an “employee retention” tax credit that's estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50% of workers' paychecks. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax. A companion appropriations package ballooned as well, growing from a $46 billion White House proposal to more than $300 billion, which dwarfs earlier disasters — including Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy combined. To provide transparency, the package is expected to create a new inspector general and oversight board for the corporate dollars, much as was done during the 2008 bank rescue, officials said. Europe is enacting its own economic recovery packages, with huge amounts of credit guarantees, government spending and other support. Germany alone, Europe's biggest economy, has agreed to commit over 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion) in fiscal stimulus and support — roughly 30 percent of that nation's entire annual output. France, Spain and Italy have launched similar programs. The European Union has suspended limits it imposes on member countries' borrowing and deficits, freeing them to spend more. Some of Europe's fiscal stimulus kicks in automatically without any new legislation due to social welfare safety nets that are more extensive than in the U.S. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death. In the United States, more than 55,000 people have been sickened and more than 800 have died. Associated Press writers Lolita C.

        ArticleContent: '"The Senate is on track to pass a mammoth $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package Wednesday evening after leaders agreed to an amendment vote aimed at appeasing a small group of GOP senators, overcoming a last-minute hurdle that had delayed quick passage of the bipartisan deal. At issue is language surrounding beefed-up unemployment insurance, which they say would allow workers to be paid more on unemployment than what they were making while employed. To mollify those concerns, leaders have agreed to allow an amendment vote on the floor, according to sources familiar with the matter. After that vote — which is expected to fail — senators can turn to final passage, sending it over to the House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi chided the GOP quartet for holding up the historic package, especially since it has bipartisan support from congressional leaders and the White House. ""We’re talking about $600,"" Pelosi said in an interview on ""PBS NewsHour"" Wednesday evening. ""People are scared, they’re in need, they have additional expenses. I don’t need to explain that to you."" The emergency package, the largest of its kind in U.S. history, comes after five days of tense negotiations between Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. It includes a dramatic expansion of unemployment insurance, a rescue fund for state and local governments, immediate cash for hospitals and a huge pool of grants and loans for small businesses. The House, meanwhile, is expected to take up the bill as early as Thursday evening. Democratic leaders have promised to give members a 24-hour notice before the scheduled vote. And Pelosi and her leadership team spent much of the day on conference calls briefing their members about the plan, even as the bill text was held up in the Senate. It is Congress’ third major bill in response to the crisis, which has infected 55,500 Americans and brought the U.S. economy to a standstill, and will not be the last. ""Today, the Senate will act to help the people of this country weather this storm,” McConnell said in an emotional speech about how the nation would fight and beat the coronavirus crisis. “Our nation needed us to go big and go fast and they did."" ""This is not even a stimulus package — it’s emergency relief,"" McConnell said. Ahead of the bill’s release, Mnuchin huddled with Senate Republicans on a conference call and senators have been given near-final drafts to review. Pelosi had originally hoped to bring the bill up via unanimous consent after Senate passage, a voting method that would not force lawmakers to return to Washington. But she said later Wednesday that House leaders were looking at other options, noting that at least some Republicans were on their way to Capitol Hill to object to the legislation when it moves to the House. Congressional leaders are now hoping to pass the package in the House with a voice vote — similar to unanimous consent in that members aren\'t required to be present but the lawmakers in the chamber can verbally register their opposition or support. The Democratic whip team is also figuring out a process for potential proxy voting, which would require a rule change but would mean fewer members have to return to the Capitol compared to a roll call vote. Still, a single member could object and demand a roll call vote. Pelosi has already advised her members that they may need to return to Washington, telling Democrats Wednesday that House leaders are talking to Capitol Police and the attending physician in preparation. House Republican leaders have privately acknowledged that there\'s a strong possibility that a member will object to a unanimous consent agreement. There has been plenty of last-minute drama with the Senate package. A furious New York Governor Andrew Cuomo held an emergency call with the House’s New York delegation at 11 a.m., where he told them “New York is dead"" and they needed to push for a stronger package, according to people familiar with the call. Cuomo later grew emotional during a press conference, lashing out at the Senate’s bill as “a drop in the bucket” for his state, which now has 30,611 coronavirus cases. Shortly after, Schumer, who represents New York and signed off on the bill, organized his own teleconference for his state’s delegation to help rally support for the bill. Still, Democrats have touted wins in the package, including $130 billion in funding for hospitals; a massive temporary expansion of unemployment benefits; federal oversight of a $500 billion fund to aid distressed industries; and a prohibition on access to loans or investments from the new programs to any of Trump’s personal businesses. Republican aides, however, accused Schumer of exaggerating some of his “wins” and countered that the GOP never objected to more money for hospitals or oversight of the $500 billion fund for corporations. Pelosi and other top Democrats have been fielding questions and complaints from their caucus in a series of calls Wednesday as rank-and-file Democrats complained that their priorities weren’t included in the Senate deal. Pelosi and her team reiterated that they will continue to fight for many of those proposals, noting there will be opportunities in the fourth stimulus bill Congress is all-but certain to craft. House Democrats are expected to be briefed on a full caucus call sometime after the Senate text is unveiled. ""This is not going to be the last bill,"" Pelosi said on PBS. ""This bill is about mitigation for the [economic] damage that is being done. … The next phase will be recovery."" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) blessed the deal in a statement Wednesday afternoon, and later told reporters at a press conference that he prefers a voice vote over a unanimous consent request. Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), who frequently objects to Congress’ biggest spending packages and isn’t beholden to party leadership, has also scoffed at the deal on Twitter, but signaled he won’t hold it up “if they have majorities to pass it.” Marianne LeVine contributed to this report."',
        AnswerContent: "\"WASHINGTON -- Senate leaders raced to unravel last-minute snags Wednesday and win passage of an unparalleled $2 trillion economic rescue package steering aid to businesses, workers and health care systems engulfed by the coronavirus pandemic. The measure is the largest economic relief bill in history, and both parties' leaders were desperate for quick passage of a bill aimed at a virus that is costing lives and jobs by the hour. The package is intended as a weekslong or monthslong patch for an economy spiraling into recession or worse and a nation facing a grim toll from an infection that's killed nearly 20,000 people worldwide. Underscoring the effort's sheer magnitude, the bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion annual federal budget. \"\"A fight has arrived on our shores,\"\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \"\"We did not seek it, we did not want it, but now we're going to win it.\"\" \"\"Big help, quick help, is on the way,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. But the drive by leaders to speed the bill through the Senate was slowed as four conservative Republican senators demanded changes, saying the legislation as written “incentivizes layoffs\"\" and should be altered to ensure employees don't earn more money if they're laid off than if they're working. Complicating the standoff, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination has flagged, said he would block the bill unless the conservatives dropped their objections. Other objections floated in from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has become a prominent Democrat on the national scene as the country battles the pandemic. Cuomo, whose state has seen more deaths from the pandemic than any other, said: “I'm telling you, these numbers don't work.\"\" Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said the package “goes a long way.\"\" He said it will require strong oversight to ensure the wealthy don't benefit at the expense of workers and proposed forgiving at least $10,000 of student loan debt as part of the federal response. McConnell and Schumer hoped passage of the legislation in the Republican-led Senate would come by the end of the day. After a banner day on Tuesday as the package took shape, the stock market rallied even more on Wednesday. Senate passage would leave final congressional approval up to the Democratic-controlled House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the bipartisan agreement “takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people” but she stopped short of fully endorsing it. “House Democrats will now review the final provisions and legislative text of the agreement to determine a course of action,” she said. House members are scattered around the country and the timetable for votes in that chamber is unclear. House Democratic and Republican leaders have hoped to clear the measure for President Donald Trump's signature by a voice vote without having to call lawmakers back to Washington. But that may prove challenging, as the bill is sure to be opposed by some conservatives upset at its cost and scope. Ardent liberals were restless as well. White House aide Eric Ueland announced the agreement in a Capitol hallway Wednesday, shortly after midnight, capping days of often intense haggling and mounting pressure. The wording of some final pieces of the agreement need to be completed. The sprawling, 500-page-plus measure is the third coronavirus response bill produced by Congress and by far the largest. It builds on efforts focused on vaccines and emergency response, sick and family medical leave for workers, and food aid. It would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines. Hospitals would get significant help as well. McConnell, a key negotiator, said the package will “rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation's health care fight. And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help Americans workers, families, small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar.\"\" Five days of arduous talks produced the bill, creating tensions among Congress' top leaders, who each took care to tend to party politics as they maneuvered and battled over crafting the legislation. But failure was never an option, which permitted both sides to mark big wins. “That Washington drama does not matter any more,” McConnell said. “The Senate is going to stand together, act together, and pass this historic relief package today.” The bill would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year, and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child A huge cash infusion for hospitals expecting a flood of COVID-19 patients grew during the talks at Schumer's insistence. Republicans pressed for tens of billions of dollars for additional relief to be delivered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the lead federal disaster agency. Democrats said the package would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time. Schumer said businesses controlled by members of Congress and top administration officials — including Trump and his immediate family members — would be ineligible for the bill's business assistance. The New York Democrat immediately sent out a roster of negotiating wins for transit systems, hospital, and cash-hungry state governments that were cemented after Democrats blocked the measure in votes held Sunday and Monday to maneuver for such gains. But Cuomo said the Senate package would send less than $4 billion to New York, far short of his estimate that the crisis will cost his state up to $15 billion over the next year. More than 280 New Yorkers have died from the virus, a death toll more than double that of any other state. Pelosi was a force behind $400 million in grants to states to expand voting by mail and other steps that Democrats billed as making voting safer but Republican critics said was political opportunism. The package also contains $15.5 billion more for a surge in demand for food stamps. Republicans won inclusion of an “employee retention” tax credit that's estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50% of workers' paychecks. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax. A companion appropriations package ballooned as well, growing from a $46 billion White House proposal to more than $300 billion, which dwarfs earlier disasters — including Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy combined. To provide transparency, the package is expected to create a new inspector general and oversight board for the corporate dollars, much as was done during the 2008 bank rescue, officials said. Europe is enacting its own economic recovery packages, with huge amounts of credit guarantees, government spending and other support. Germany alone, Europe's biggest economy, has agreed to commit over 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion) in fiscal stimulus and support — roughly 30 percent of that nation's entire annual output. France, Spain and Italy have launched similar programs. The European Union has suspended limits it imposes on member countries' borrowing and deficits, freeing them to spend more. Some of Europe's fiscal stimulus kicks in automatically without any new legislation due to social welfare safety nets that are more extensive than in the U.S. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death. In the United States, more than 55,000 people have been sickened and more than 800 have died. Associated Press writers Lolita C. Baldor, Zeke Miller, Mary Clare Jalonick, Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Alan Fram and Padmananda Rama contributed to this report. \"",

        ArticleContent: '"The Senate is on track to pass a mammoth $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package Wednesday evening after leaders agreed to an amendment vote aimed at appeasing a small group of GOP senators, overcoming a last-minute hurdle that had delayed quick passage of the bipartisan deal. At issue is language surrounding beefed-up unemployment insurance, which they say would allow workers to be paid more on unemployment than what they were making while employed. To mollify those concerns, leaders have agreed to allow an amendment vote on the floor, according to sources familiar with the matter. After that vote — which is expected to fail — senators can turn to final passage, sending it over to the House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi chided the GOP quartet for holding up the historic package, especially since it has bipartisan support from congressional leaders and the White House. ""We’re talking about $600,"" Pelosi said in an interview on ""PBS NewsHour"" Wednesday evening. ""People are scared, they’re in need, they have additional expenses. I don’t need to explain that to you."" The emergency package, the largest of its kind in U.S. history, comes after five days of tense negotiations between Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. It includes a dramatic expansion of unemployment insurance, a rescue fund for state and local governments, immediate cash for hospitals and a huge pool of grants and loans for small businesses. The House, meanwhile, is expected to take up the bill as early as Thursday evening. Democratic leaders have promised to give members a 24-hour notice before the scheduled vote. And Pelosi and her leadership team spent much of the day on conference calls briefing their members about the plan, even as the bill text was held up in the Senate. It is Congress’ third major bill in response to the crisis, which has infected 55,500 Americans and brought the U.S. economy to a standstill, and will not be the last. ""Today, the Senate will act to help the people of this country weather this storm,” McConnell said in an emotional speech about how the nation would fight and beat the coronavirus crisis. “Our nation needed us to go big and go fast and they did."" ""This is not even a stimulus package — it’s emergency relief,"" McConnell said. Ahead of the bill’s release, Mnuchin huddled with Senate Republicans on a conference call and senators have been given near-final drafts to review. Pelosi had originally hoped to bring the bill up via unanimous consent after Senate passage, a voting method that would not force lawmakers to return to Washington. But she said later Wednesday that House leaders were looking at other options, noting that at least some Republicans were on their way to Capitol Hill to object to the legislation when it moves to the House. Congressional leaders are now hoping to pass the package in the House with a voice vote — similar to unanimous consent in that members aren\'t required to be present but the lawmakers in the chamber can verbally register their opposition or support. The Democratic whip team is also figuring out a process for potential proxy voting, which would require a rule change but would mean fewer members have to return to the Capitol compared to a roll call vote. Still, a single member could object and demand a roll call vote. Pelosi has already advised her members that they may need to return to Washington, telling Democrats Wednesday that House leaders are talking to Capitol Police and the attending physician in preparation. House Republican leaders have privately acknowledged that there\'s a strong possibility that a member will object to a unanimous consent agreement. There has been plenty of last-minute drama with the Senate package. A furious New York Governor Andrew Cuomo held an emergency call with the House’s New York delegation at 11 a.m., where he told them “New York is dead"" and they needed to push for a stronger package, according to people familiar with the call. Cuomo later grew emotional during a press conference, lashing out at the Senate’s bill as “a drop in the bucket” for his state, which now has 30,611 coronavirus cases. Shortly after, Schumer, who represents New York and signed off on the bill, organized his own teleconference for his state’s delegation to help rally support for the bill. Still, Democrats have touted wins in the package, including $130 billion in funding for hospitals; a massive temporary expansion of unemployment benefits; federal oversight of a $500 billion fund to aid distressed industries; and a prohibition on access to loans or investments from the new programs to any of Trump’s personal businesses. Republican aides, however, accused Schumer of exaggerating some of his “wins” and countered that the GOP never objected to more money for hospitals or oversight of the $500 billion fund for corporations. Pelosi and other top Democrats have been fielding questions and complaints from their caucus in a series of calls Wednesday as rank-and-file Democrats complained that their priorities weren’t included in the Senate deal. Pelosi and her team reiterated that they will continue to fight for many of those proposals, noting there will be opportunities in the fourth stimulus bill Congress is all-but certain to craft. House Democrats are expected to be briefed on a full caucus call sometime after the Senate text is unveiled. ""This is not going to be the last bill,"" Pelosi said on PBS. ""This bill is about mitigation for the [economic] damage that is being done. … The next phase will be recovery."" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) blessed the deal in a statement Wednesday afternoon, and later told reporters at a press conference that he prefers a voice vote over a unanimous consent request. Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), who frequently objects to Congress’ biggest spending packages and isn’t beholden to party leadership, has also scoffed at the deal on Twitter, but signaled he won’t hold it up “if they have majorities to pass it.” Marianne LeVine contributed to this report."',

        ArticleContent: '"The Senate is on track to pass a mammoth $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package Wednesday evening after leaders agreed to an amendment vote aimed at appeasing a small group of GOP senators, overcoming a last-minute hurdle that had delayed quick passage of the bipartisan deal. At issue is language surrounding beefed-up unemployment insurance, which they say would allow workers to be paid more on unemployment than what they were making while employed. To mollify those concerns, leaders have agreed to allow an amendment vote on the floor, according to sources familiar with the matter. After that vote — which is expected to fail — senators can turn to final passage, sending it over to the House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi chided the GOP quartet for holding up the historic package, especially since it has bipartisan support from congressional leaders and the White House. ""We’re talking about $600,"" Pelosi said in an interview on ""PBS NewsHour"" Wednesday evening. ""People are scared, they’re in need, they have additional expenses. I don’t need to explain that to you."" The emergency package, the largest of its kind in U.S. history, comes after five days of tense negotiations between Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. It includes a dramatic expansion of unemployment insurance, a rescue fund for state and local governments, immediate cash for hospitals and a huge pool of grants and loans for small businesses. The House, meanwhile, is expected to take up the bill as early as Thursday evening. Democratic leaders have promised to give members a 24-hour notice before the scheduled vote. And Pelosi and her leadership team spent much of the day on conference calls briefing their members about the plan, even as the bill text was held up in the Senate. It is Congress’ third major bill in response to the crisis, which has infected 55,500 Americans and brought the U.S. economy to a standstill, and will not be the last. ""Today, the Senate will act to help the people of this country weather this storm,” McConnell said in an emotional speech about how the nation would fight and beat the coronavirus crisis. “Our nation needed us to go big and go fast and they did."" ""This is not even a stimulus package — it’s emergency relief,"" McConnell said. Ahead of the bill’s release, Mnuchin huddled with Senate Republicans on a conference call and senators have been given near-final drafts to review. Pelosi had originally hoped to bring the bill up via unanimous consent after Senate passage, a voting method that would not force lawmakers to return to Washington. But she said later Wednesday that House leaders were looking at other options, noting that at least some Republicans were on their way to Capitol Hill to object to the legislation when it moves to the House. Congressional leaders are now hoping to pass the package in the House with a voice vote — similar to unanimous consent in that members aren\'t required to be present but the lawmakers in the chamber can verbally register their opposition or support. The Democratic whip team is also figuring out a process for potential proxy voting, which would require a rule change but would mean fewer members have to return to the Capitol compared to a roll call vote. Still, a single member could object and demand a roll call vote. Pelosi has already advised her members that they may need to return to Washington, telling Democrats Wednesday that House leaders are talking to Capitol Police and the attending physician in preparation. House Republican leaders have privately acknowledged that there\'s a strong possibility that a member will object to a unanimous consent agreement. There has been plenty of last-minute drama with the Senate package. A furious New York Governor Andrew Cuomo held an emergency call with the House’s New York delegation at 11 a.m., where he told them “New York is dead"" and they needed to push for a stronger package, according to people familiar with the call. Cuomo later grew emotional during a press conference, lashing out at the Senate’s bill as “a drop in the bucket” for his state, which now has 30,611 coronavirus cases. Shortly after, Schumer, who represents New York and signed off on the bill, organized his own teleconference for his state’s delegation to help rally support for the bill. Still, Democrats have touted wins in the package, including $130 billion in funding for hospitals; a massive temporary expansion of unemployment benefits; federal oversight of a $500 billion fund to aid distressed industries; and a prohibition on access to loans or investments from the new programs to any of Trump’s personal businesses. Republican aides, however, accused Schumer of exaggerating some of his “wins” and countered that the GOP never objected to more money for hospitals or oversight of the $500 billion fund for corporations. Pelosi and other top Democrats have been fielding questions and complaints from their caucus in a series of calls Wednesday as rank-and-file Democrats complained that their priorities weren’t included in the Senate deal. Pelosi and her team reiterated that they will continue to fight for many of those proposals, noting there will be opportunities in the fourth stimulus bill Congress is all-but certain to craft. House Democrats are expected to be briefed on a full caucus call sometime after the Senate text is unveiled. ""This is not going to be the last bill,"" Pelosi said on PBS. ""This bill is about mitigation for the [economic] damage that is being done. … The next phase will be recovery."" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) blessed the deal in a statement Wednesday afternoon, and later told reporters at a press conference that he prefers a voice vote over a unanimous consent request. Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), who frequently objects to Congress’ biggest spending packages and isn’t beholden to party leadership, has also scoffed at the deal on Twitter, but signaled he won’t hold it up “if they have majorities to pass it.” Marianne LeVine contributed to this report."',
        AnswerContent: '"The 880-page legislation is the largest economic relief bill in U.S. history. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., appeared somber and exhausted as he announced the vote. He released senators from Washington until April 20, though he promised to recall them if needed. ""96-0 in the United States Senate,"" President Trump wrote on Twitter. ""Congratulations AMERICA!"" The unanimous vote came despite misgivings on both sides about whether it goes too far or not far enough. The vote capped days of difficult negotiations as Washington confronted a national challenge unlike any it has ever faced. Unemployment numbers were set to be revealed Thursday morning, and experts warned they could reach alarming new highs. The package would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year, and $2,400 to married couples making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child. After a $75,000 threshold for individuals, the benefit would be reduced by $5 for each $100 the taxpayer makes. A similar $150,000 threshold applies to couples, and a $112,500 threshold for heads of households. The legislation passed by the Senate will use 2019 tax returns, if available, or 2018 tax returns to assess income for determining how much direct financial aid individuals receive. Those who did not file tax returns can use a Form SSA-1099, Social Security Benefit Statement or Form RRB-1099, a Social Security Equivalent Benefit Statement, per Page 149 of the bill. Further, the bill allocates $250 billion to extend unemployment insurance to more workers, and lengthen the duration to 39 weeks, up from the normal 26 weeks. $600 extra a week would be provided for four months. (Just before voting on the final package began late Wednesday, the Senate was debating an amendment from Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., to bar people from getting more from new unemployment benefits than they would have received on the job; the amendment needed 60 votes and failed 48-48.) The final package would additionally provide $349 billion in loans to small businesses -- and money spent on rent, payroll and utilities becomes grants that don\'t need to be paid back. Many hotels would qualify as small businesses under the plan. Passenger airlines would receive $25 billion for workers\' ""salaries and benefits,"" plus up to $25 billion more in loan guarantees and loans. Contract workers would also receive $3 billion in assistance. Airlines would have to agree not to furlough workers until at least the end of September in return. About $17 billion will go to other distressed companies like Boeing, which is seen as essential to national security. And, approximately $200 billion would be provided in tax assistance to small businesses, including through payroll tax deferrals. At the same time, the bill omits many -- though not all -- items from Pelosi\'s version of the legislation that Republicans had called wasteful or irrelevant, including climate-change-related emissions restrictions for airlines and various diversity-related provisions. Gone from the stimulus bill are mentions of mandatory early voting, ballot harvesting, requirements that federal agencies review their usage of ""minority banks,"" and attempts to curb airlines\' carbon emissions -- a Pelosi demand that even Saikat Chakrabarti, the former chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and an author of the Green New Deal, called ""ridiculous."" ""What\'s not in the Senate\'s bipartisan coronavirus bill: Pelosi\'s outrageous wish list,"" wrote GOP national spokesperson Elizabeth Harrington. ""0 mentions of \'diversity.\' 0 mentions of \'emissions.\' 0 mentions of \'early voting.\' 0 mentions of \'climate change.\' Good!"" But, the package still contained some wins for Pelosi. Page 524 of the bill text indicates that many businesses that take a government loan would be obligated to remain neutral in any ""union organizing effort"" during the loan -- a major giveaway to unions. Affected businesses would have between 500 and 10,000 employees. And, Page 781 of the bill provides $25 million to the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives to cover ""salary and expenses."" Also in the final bill text, $25 million would still be allocated for the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Trump, speaking at the White House coronavirus briefing earlier Wednesday, said that he understood the provision was necessary because Democrats demanded some concessions in order to get the stimulus bill passed, even though it galled some conservatives. Pelosi was the first to demand the Kennedy Center money in her own bill, which Republicans said was full of unseemly payouts for well-connected special interests at a time of national crisis. The Kennedy Center put out a statement Wednesday evening saying it was ""extraordinarily grateful that Congress has recognized our institution\'s unique status and has included funding in its legislation to ensure that we can reopen our doors and stages as soon as we are able."" ""For an opera house, you sure are tone-deaf,"" responded blogger Jim Treacher, after telling the Kennedy Center where to shove its statement. Meanwhile, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said the House would vote on the matter on Friday. Republican leaders said they\'d whip votes to support the bill. ""Over the past few days, the Senate has stepped into the breach,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in his own remarks. ""We packed weeks or perhaps months of the legislative process into five days. Representatives from both sides of the aisle and both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue have forged a bipartisan agreement in highly partisan times, with very little time to spare."" He added: ""It’s been a long, hard road, with a remarkable number of twists and turns, but for the sake of millions of Americans, it will be worth it. It will be worth it to get help to millions of small businesses and save tens of millions of jobs."" However, earlier in the day, a senior GOP source told Fox News contributor and Townhall.com editor Guy Benson that the compromise bill was a face-saving exercise by Schumer, and that he was trying to ""take credit"" for a GOP bill that he filibustered for ""small ball"" alterations. Democrats, the source said, couldn\'t drag the situation out much longer; economic conditions have worsened dramatically, and President Trump\'s approval rating has risen. And, a senior Republican aide separately told Fox News: ""I half expected that the next thing I read would be the Minority Leader taking credit for inventing fire. The reality is that almost every significant \'win\' he\'s taking credit for, is actually a Senate Republican idea."" Republicans had ""never objected"" to more hospital funding, or that oversight of the stimulus stabilization fund ""be structured almost exactly like TARP oversight,"" the aide went on. And Republicans were the first to push for three months of unemployment insurance and ""did not oppose adding a fourth."" The stimulus movement came as stocks posted their first back-to-back gains in weeks, but much of Wednesday\'s early rally faded as the hitch developed in the Senate. The market is down nearly 27 percent since setting a record high a month ago. Amid the debate, presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders said he might try to torpedo the Senate\'s stimulus package as Republican senators raised objections about what they called a ""massive drafting error"" related to unemployment benefits. “In my view, it would be an outrage to prevent working-class Americans to receive the emergency unemployment assistance included in this legislation,"" Sanders said in a statement, also posted on social media. Sanders took to the Senate floor late Wednesday at approximately 9:30 p.m. ET to say he was concerned that the administration would be able to ""expend $500 billion in virtually any way they want"" under the legislation. In fact, the administration would not have such unilateral control. ""They\'re very upset that somebody who is making 10, 12 bucks an hour might end up with a paycheck for four months more than they received last week,"" Sanders went on. ""Oh, my god, the universe is collapsing!"" The concern from Sens. Lindsey Graham, Tim Scott, R-S.C., Sasse, and Rick Scott, R-Fla., was that the the bill could pay workers more in unemployment benefits than they\'d make in salary, by sticking a $600 per week payment on top of ordinary benefits that are calculated as a percentage of income. Democrats and economists have countered that the point of the new unemployment benefit is, in fact, to make peoples\' salaries whole, and that companies could simply raise wages to compete and attract workers. ""The weird thing about this hypothetical \'generous unemployment pay will discourage people from entering critical industries\' is... they could just raise wages?"" Alex Godofsky wrote on Twitter. ""Amazon has already raised wages. Like, it\'s okay if wages - and prices - go up for a while. It\'s fine."" Others have noted that the unemployment benefits boost would expire in the summer. In an article entitled ""Republican Senators’ Objection to Expanded Unemployment Benefits Makes Little Sense,"" Josh Barro began by noting that ""these are unemployment benefits, and you generally have to have been laid off to claim them."" ""We will continue to have virus-mitigation measures that create mass unemployment for a significant period, and even after those measures can be relaxed through much of the country, it will take some time for employers to re-ingest all the previously laid-off workers,"" Barro wrote. ""In fact, it’s likely that the shutdowns will persist long enough that the enhanced benefits will need to be extended. If we’re in a situation by July where all the shutdowns are over and employers are eagerly hiring and our biggest concern is too many people don’t want to go back to work, I will be overjoyed and very surprised."" Later Wednesday, the Republicans agreed to drop their objections to fast-tracking the stimulus vote, as long as there was first a vote on the Sasse amendment to cap unemployment benefits to 100 percent of salary. Also in the evening, Pelosi said unanimous consent was a nonstarter in the House, and implied that quick passage in the lower chamber may be unrealistic. Pelosi has called for members to have at least 24 hours to review the bill text once it\'s available. “That’s not gonna work,"" she told reporters shortly after 7:30 p.m. ET, referring to unanimous consent. ""Republicans have told us that’s not possible from their said. ... What I’d like to see -- because this a $2 trillion bill -- I’d like to see a good debate on the floor."" Meanwhile, the White House projected confidence. Insistently optimistic, President Trump said of the greatest public-health emergency in anyone\'s lifetime, ""I don’t think it\'s going to end up being such a rough patch"" and anticipated the economy soaring “like a rocket ship” when it\'s over. Yet he implored Congress late in the day to move on critical aid without further delay. The package is intended as relief for an economy spiraling into recession or worse and a nation facing a grim toll from an infection that\'s killed nearly 20,000 people worldwide. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, asked how long the aid would keep the economy afloat, said: “We’ve anticipated three months. Hopefully, we won’t need this for three months."" Underscoring the effort\'s sheer magnitude, the bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion annual federal budget.

But how long will it last and is this an infringement of privacy, rights groups have asked. In China, government-installed CCTV cameras point at the apartment door of those under a 14-day quarantine to ensure they don\'t leave. Drones tell people to wear their masks. Digital barcodes on mobile apps highlight the health status of individuals.  Other nations like Israel, Singapore and South Korea are also using a combination of location data, video camera footage and credit card information, to track COVID-19 in their countries. — Arjun Kharpal From Saturday, foreign nationals holding valid visas or residence permits for China will not be allowed to enter the country, China\'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement Thursday.  Entry by foreign nationals with Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Business Travel Cards, port visas, and visa-free transit policies through some Chinese cities will also be suspended, it said. Foreign nationals coming to the country for ""necessary economic, trade, scientific or technological activities or out of emergency humanitarian needs"" can still apply for visas and enter China on them, if issued, according to the ministry. As the coronavirus spread rapidly around the world, China has attributed most new confirmed cases of the disease in the country to travelers returning from overseas. Cities such as Beijing have announced strict 14-day quarantine policies for those arriving from other countries. — Evelyn Cheng People in Singapore who do not observe physical distancing of one meter in ""non-transient"" interactions can be fined up to 10,000 Singapore dollars ($6,985) or jailed up to six months, or both, the Ministry of Health said in a press release on Thursday. The regulations kicked in overnight and will run till April 30. The stiff penalties also apply to patients with acute respiratory symptoms issued with five days of medical leave who depart from their homes during that period. Residents who breach 14-day stay home notices issued to them after their return from another country will also have to comply or face fines and jail. Singapore on Tuesday announced stricter measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus. These include limiting gatherings outside of work and school to a maximum of 10 persons.

        ArticleContent: "\"In some parts of the U.S., authorities say gun shops aren’t essential businesses and should close during stay-at-home orders meant to slow the coronavirus. In other places, officials are stopping background checks for concealed carry permits. Elsewhere, city leaders have invoked emergency powers allowing bans on gun sales. As the nation grapples with a pandemic that has upended daily life, some gun rights advocates are concerned about an erosion of Second Amendment rights just as Americans are buying firearms in record numbers to try to ensure their safety. “When there’s a national emergency, people are looking for food, water, shelter - that part is important to the survival of our nation,” said Michael Cargill, owner of Central Texas Gun Works in Austin. “They are also looking for the Second Amendment to protect their families.” TOP STORIES Lawmakers racing back to D.C. to vote on $2.2T coronavirus rescue plan after lone Republican objects 'Directly and very forcefully': Canada tells Trump not to send troops to border British PM Boris Johnson tests positive for coronavirus He’s scaled back how long he’s open each day but said he won’t close his shop and doesn’t believe he should be forced to. In recent weeks, firearm sales have skyrocketed. Background checks - the key barometer of gun sales - already were at record numbers in January and February, likely fueled by a presidential election year. Since the coronavirus outbreak, gun shops have reported long lines and runs on firearms and ammunition. Background checks were up 300 percent on March 16 compared with the same date a year ago, according to federal data shared with the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents gunmakers. Since Feb. 23, each day has seen roughly double the volume over 2019, according to Mark Oliva, spokesman for the group. “When people aren’t able to provide for their own security or their own safety, they’re going to take measures to make sure that they can. That’s why we have that Second Amendment,” Oliva said. “This is a public safety issue.” The federal background check system has been overwhelmed by the massive increase in firearm sales. What might normally take a few minutes is taking much longer, and a backlog on background checks has ballooned to about 80,000, Oliva said. If a background check takes longer than three business days, gun dealers are permitted to allow the sale to go through unless a state has stricter waiting periods. But the National Shooting Sports Foundation has advised gun dealers not to feel beholden to complete the sale if they have concerns about the potential buyer. “We are cautioning retailers that they may want to exercise patience and prudence,” Oliva said. Even some gun control advocates say it might not be wise to shut down federally licensed firearms dealers, whose sales require background checks. That could force buyers to use a website or seek a private sale that doesn’t require a check, making it more difficult to trace a firearm if it’s used in a crime. There are risks to both closing a gun shop or keeping it open, said David Chipman, a retired agent with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. “If you keep it open, there’s the risk of first-time buyers who are largely buying out of fear and panic and untrained,” said Chipman, now senior policy adviser for Giffords, a gun control advocacy group. Gun control advocates are concerned about a large number of new owners lacking the usual access to training on how to store and handle their weapon properly. They also worry that Americans who are stocking up now eventually will sell their firearms privately. “If we can imagine how horrible this crisis is … the people who hoarded the guns might decide six months from now - once they see no zombies around but they’ve run out of tuna and beef jerky - that they need the money to buy food,” Chipman said. In a number of U.S. cities, including New Orleans, the mayor has issued an emergency proclamation that declares the authority to restrict sales of firearms and ammunition. In some states that have ordered people to stay home, gun stores were not among the businesses deemed essential and allowed to stay open, like grocery stores. That has led to confusion in California, where for the second time this week, Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva ordered gun shops to close, challenging a finding by the legal counsel for the nation’s most populous county that the stores are essential businesses. David Prince, owner of Eagle Gun Range in Farmers Branch, Texas, near Dallas, had to temporarily close his store under Dallas County’s stay-at-home order, then was allowed to reopen Wednesday when gun stores were reclassified as essential. Prince said gun stores are critical because they give people the chance to defend themselves. “I always knew people were going to want to protect themselves. What I was concerned about was the look in their faces, they are covered in fear,” Prince said. “If I give them the ability to have a firearm, it gives them a fighting chance to defend their family.” The range that is part of his store is considered nonessential and has been forced to close, meaning new gun buyers can’t use it to train on how to handle their firearm. \"",
        AnswerContent: '"Gun sales have stopped in several Texas counties that have deemed gun stores as non-essential businesses during COVID-19 local emergency declarations, but some shops are still open and most continue selling firearms online. Tarrant County officials issued an order Saturday to close down all non-essential businesses to the public. The essential business summary did not include gun shops, but Tarrant County Judge Glen Whitley said they can continue to sell guns as long as they process the orders offsite and customers only show up to pick up their merchandise. “We’re not treating gun shops any different than other retail stores,” said Whitley, “They can order online, they can go in, they can go to the front desk, pay for it and leave.” Dan Boykin, owner of Advantage Firearms in northeast Fort Worth, said he closed after reading about the essential business summary on a news outlet Monday. He’s been taking orders online but said the waiting period for distributors that fill those orders has gone from one day to nearly two weeks. Academy Sports and Outdoors in Fort Worth was closed Wednesday morning and they were not taking online orders, according to their employees, who were instructed to stop all gun sales. One store manager said orders made online were being canceled once they were received at their store and customers who made their orders before the ban would have to wait until after the ban was lifted to pick up their orders. In some neighboring counties also with declarations of local disaster and shelter-at-home orders, gun shops haven’t closed to the public. Parker County issued a public health emergency Monday that did not include gun stores as essential businesses, but some stores kept their doors open. “I don’t think there is any crisis big enough to take away people’s Second Amendment right,” said Austin Kincaid, store manager at SOS Arms in Weatherford. Jose Gonzalez, a phone broker at Uncle Dan’s Pawn in South Dallas, said they were an essential business and had nearly sold out of guns Wednesday morning. Most counties in Texas including Dallas have hardware stores, which include pawn shops, in their list of essential retail. Judge Whitley in Tarrant County said that if a store falls under the essential list but sells other items, including guns, they can continue to open to the public and sell any item in the store. At least 18 counties had issued stay-at-home orders as of Wednesday. Gun shops were closed in the cities of Austin, Waco and Lubbock, and Tarrant, Dallas, Travis and Bexar counties, according to the Texas State Rifle Association. In a recent email to their members, the association argued that banning the sale of guns could be a violation of the state firearms preemption law. “During an emergency, food, water, shelter and adequate medical care are paramount for survival, but so too is the ability of an individual to protect his or herself, as well as their family, home, business and property,” reads the letter. State Representative Dustin Burrows (R-Lubbock), Chairman of the Texas House Committee on Ways & Means, formally requested an opinion Monday from Attorney General Ken Paxton on whether cities or counties can prohibit the sale of firearms. Burrows’ letter claims that Texas’ state firearms preemption law restricts city and county officials from regulating the sale and transfer of firearms even during a natural disaster. "',

In recent weeks, firearm sales have skyrocketed. Background checks - the key barometer of gun sales - already were at record numbers in January and February, likely fueled by a presidential election year. Since the coronavirus outbreak, gun shops have reported long lines and runs on firearms and ammunition. Background checks were up 300 percent on March 16 compared with the same date a year ago, according to federal data shared with the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents gunmakers. Since Feb. 23, each day has seen roughly double the volume over 2019, according to Mark Oliva, spokesman for the group. “When people aren’t able to provide for their own security or their own safety, they’re going to take measures to make sure that they can. That’s why we have that Second Amendment,” Oliva said. “This is a public safety issue.” The federal background check system has been overwhelmed by the massive increase in firearm sales. What might normally take a few minutes is taking much longer, and a backlog on background checks has ballooned to about 80,000, Oliva said. If a background check takes longer than three business days, gun dealers are permitted to allow the sale to go through unless a state has stricter waiting periods. But the National Shooting Sports Foundation has advised gun dealers not to feel beholden to complete the sale if they have concerns about the potential buyer. “We are cautioning retailers that they may want to exercise patience and prudence,” Oliva said. Even some gun control advocates say it might not be wise to shut down federally licensed firearms dealers, whose sales require background checks. That could force buyers to use a website or seek a private sale that doesn’t require a check, making it more difficult to trace a firearm if it’s used in a crime. There are risks to both closing a gun shop or keeping it open, said David Chipman, a retired agent with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. “If you keep it open, there’s the risk of first-time buyers who are largely buying out of fear and panic and untrained,” said Chipman, now senior policy adviser for Giffords, a gun control advocacy group. Gun control advocates are concerned about a large number of new owners lacking the usual access to training on how to store and handle their weapon properly. They also worry that Americans who are stocking up now eventually will sell their firearms privately. “If we can imagine how horrible this crisis is … the people who hoarded the guns might decide six months from now - once they see no zombies around but they’ve run out of tuna and beef jerky - that they need the money to buy food,” Chipman said.

        AnswerContent: '"Johannesburg (AFP) - South Africa recorded its first two deaths from the novel coronavirus on Friday as the number of confirmed cases breached the 1,000 mark just hours after a three-week nationwide lockdown swung into action. ""This morning we wake South Africans up with sad news that we now have our first deaths resulting from COVID-19,"" Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said in a statement. President Cyril Ramaphosa has ordered the 57-strong population of Africa\'s most industrialised nation to stay at home for 21 days, joining other countries across the continent which have imposed strict measures to halt the spread of the disease. But many people defied the order which came into effect at midnight Thursday, lining up outside food stores or at bus terminals. Police appeared overwhelmed in downtown Johannesburg on Friday where hundreds of shoppers pushed and shoved trying to force their way into a supermarket. ""The lockdown is a good thing for the country, even though I feel that a lot of people and taking it for granted, saying this virus is not for us... which is bad because by the time we wake up this thing will have spread enormously in the country,"" said bank employee Dumisani July, 39, wearing a mask and black latex gloves. Mkhize said the two people died in the Western Cape province, and announced that the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases have topped 1,000. On Thursday, the country had reported 927 confirmed cases, a jump of more than 30 percent from the previous day, with Ramaphosa projecting it could reach 1,500 ""within a few days"". Kenya, Rwanda and Mali are some of the African countries that have imposed restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus, which has been confirmed to have infected more than 3,200 people and killed 89 across the continent. Although Africa\'s toll is far lower than in Europe, the United States and the Middle East, health experts say the world\'s poorest continent is especially vulnerable and the figures likely fall far short of the reality. Donning a camouflage uniform complete with a cap, Ramaphosa on Thursday saw off soldiers before they deployed from a military base in Soweto township outside economic hub Johannesburg. ""This is unprecedented, not only in our democracy but also in the history of our country, that we will have a lockdown for 21 days to go out and wage war against an invisible enemy coronavirus,"" he said. During the shutdown, jogging, dog-walking and the sale of alcohol are banned across the country, which so far has the highest number of detected infections in sub-Saharan Africa. Violation of any of the regulations will carry a six-month jail sentence or a fine. In West Africa, Nigeria\'s government warned Thursday that Africa\'s most populous nation could soon see an ""exponential"" increase in infections unless contacts of confirmed cases are tracked down more rapidly. - \'War against invisible enemy\' - Kenya, which has 31 cases, on Thursday recorded its first death -- a 66-year-old Kenyan man who had travelled from South Africa on March 13. The east African country will begin a night-time curfew on Friday to try curtail the spread. In the Sahel, Burkina Faso, which last week recorded sub-Saharan Africa\'s first death, announced that eight towns, including the capital Ouagadougou, would be quarantined from Friday. ""Quarantined means that nobody will enter or leave the towns involved,"" Communication Minister Remis Fulgance Dandjinou said, adding that the measure would be applied for two weeks. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, authorities ordered a four-day ""total confinement"" in the capital Kinshasa starting Saturday. Moody\'s Investors Service warned that the fallout from the border closures, commodity price declines and financial market volatility will have ""severe macroeconomic and financial impact"" on African sovereign debt."',

        ArticleContent: '"The Senate is on track to pass a mammoth $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package Wednesday evening after leaders agreed to an amendment vote aimed at appeasing a small group of GOP senators, overcoming a last-minute hurdle that had delayed quick passage of the bipartisan deal. At issue is language surrounding beefed-up unemployment insurance, which they say would allow workers to be paid more on unemployment than what they were making while employed. To mollify those concerns, leaders have agreed to allow an amendment vote on the floor, according to sources familiar with the matter. After that vote — which is expected to fail — senators can turn to final passage, sending it over to the House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi chided the GOP quartet for holding up the historic package, especially since it has bipartisan support from congressional leaders and the White House. ""We’re talking about $600,"" Pelosi said in an interview on ""PBS NewsHour"" Wednesday evening. ""People are scared, they’re in need, they have additional expenses. I don’t need to explain that to you."" The emergency package, the largest of its kind in U.S. history, comes after five days of tense negotiations between Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. It includes a dramatic expansion of unemployment insurance, a rescue fund for state and local governments, immediate cash for hospitals and a huge pool of grants and loans for small businesses. The House, meanwhile, is expected to take up the bill as early as Thursday evening. Democratic leaders have promised to give members a 24-hour notice before the scheduled vote. And Pelosi and her leadership team spent much of the day on conference calls briefing their members about the plan, even as the bill text was held up in the Senate. It is Congress’ third major bill in response to the crisis, which has infected 55,500 Americans and brought the U.S. economy to a standstill, and will not be the last. ""Today, the Senate will act to help the people of this country weather this storm,” McConnell said in an emotional speech about how the nation would fight and beat the coronavirus crisis. “Our nation needed us to go big and go fast and they did."" ""This is not even a stimulus package — it’s emergency relief,"" McConnell said. Ahead of the bill’s release, Mnuchin huddled with Senate Republicans on a conference call and senators have been given near-final drafts to review. Pelosi had originally hoped to bring the bill up via unanimous consent after Senate passage, a voting method that would not force lawmakers to return to Washington. But she said later Wednesday that House leaders were looking at other options, noting that at least some Republicans were on their way to Capitol Hill to object to the legislation when it moves to the House. Congressional leaders are now hoping to pass the package in the House with a voice vote — similar to unanimous consent in that members aren\'t required to be present but the lawmakers in the chamber can verbally register their opposition or support. The Democratic whip team is also figuring out a process for potential proxy voting, which would require a rule change but would mean fewer members have to return to the Capitol compared to a roll call vote. Still, a single member could object and demand a roll call vote. Pelosi has already advised her members that they may need to return to Washington, telling Democrats Wednesday that House leaders are talking to Capitol Police and the attending physician in preparation. House Republican leaders have privately acknowledged that there\'s a strong possibility that a member will object to a unanimous consent agreement. There has been plenty of last-minute drama with the Senate package. A furious New York Governor Andrew Cuomo held an emergency call with the House’s New York delegation at 11 a.m., where he told them “New York is dead"" and they needed to push for a stronger package, according to people familiar with the call. Cuomo later grew emotional during a press conference, lashing out at the Senate’s bill as “a drop in the bucket” for his state, which now has 30,611 coronavirus cases. Shortly after, Schumer, who represents New York and signed off on the bill, organized his own teleconference for his state’s delegation to help rally support for the bill. Still, Democrats have touted wins in the package, including $130 billion in funding for hospitals; a massive temporary expansion of unemployment benefits; federal oversight of a $500 billion fund to aid distressed industries; and a prohibition on access to loans or investments from the new programs to any of Trump’s personal businesses. Republican aides, however, accused Schumer of exaggerating some of his “wins” and countered that the GOP never objected to more money for hospitals or oversight of the $500 billion fund for corporations. Pelosi and other top Democrats have been fielding questions and complaints from their caucus in a series of calls Wednesday as rank-and-file Democrats complained that their priorities weren’t included in the Senate deal. Pelosi and her team reiterated that they will continue to fight for many of those proposals, noting there will be opportunities in the fourth stimulus bill Congress is all-but certain to craft. House Democrats are expected to be briefed on a full caucus call sometime after the Senate text is unveiled. ""This is not going to be the last bill,"" Pelosi said on PBS. ""This bill is about mitigation for the [economic] damage that is being done. … The next phase will be recovery."" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) blessed the deal in a statement Wednesday afternoon, and later told reporters at a press conference that he prefers a voice vote over a unanimous consent request. Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), who frequently objects to Congress’ biggest spending packages and isn’t beholden to party leadership, has also scoffed at the deal on Twitter, but signaled he won’t hold it up “if they have majorities to pass it.” Marianne LeVine contributed to this report."',
        AnswerContent: "\"Senate leaders raced to unravel last-minute snags Wednesday and win passage of an unparalleled $2 trillion economic rescue package steering aid to businesses, workers and health care systems engulfed by the coronavirus pandemic. The measure is the largest economic relief bill in history, and both parties' leaders were desperate for quick passage of a bill aimed at a virus that is costing lives and jobs by the hour. The package is intended as a weekslong or monthslong patch for an economy spiraling into recession or worse and a nation facing a grim toll from an infection that's killed nearly 20,000 people worldwide. Underscoring the effort's sheer magnitude, the bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion annual federal budget. \"\"A fight has arrived on our shores,\"\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \"\"We did not seek it, we did not want it, but now we're going to win it.\"\" \"\"Big help, quick help, is on the way,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. But the drive by leaders to speed the bill through the Senate was slowed as four conservative Republican senators demanded changes, saying the legislation as written “incentivizes layoffs\"\" and should be altered to ensure employees don't earn more money if they're laid off than if they're working. Complicating the standoff, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination has flagged, said he would block the bill unless the conservatives dropped their objections. Other objections floated in from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has become a prominent Democrat on the national scene as the country battles the pandemic. Cuomo, whose state has seen more deaths from the pandemic than any other, said: “I'm telling you, these numbers don't work.\"\" Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said the package “goes a long way.\"\" He said it will require strong oversight to ensure the wealthy don't benefit at the expense of workers and proposed forgiving at least $10,000 of student loan debt as part of the federal response. McConnell and Schumer hoped passage of the legislation in the Republican-led Senate would come by the end of the day. After a banner day on Tuesday as the package took shape, the stock market rallied even more on Wednesday. Senate passage would leave final congressional approval up to the Democratic-controlled House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the bipartisan agreement “takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people” but she stopped short of fully endorsing it. “House Democrats will now review the final provisions and legislative text of the agreement to determine a course of action,” she said. House members are scattered around the country and the timetable for votes in that chamber is unclear. House Democratic and Republican leaders have hoped to clear the measure for President Donald Trump's signature by a voice vote without having to call lawmakers back to Washington. But that may prove challenging, as the bill is sure to be opposed by some conservatives upset at its cost and scope. Ardent liberals were restless as well. White House aide Eric Ueland announced the agreement in a Capitol hallway Wednesday, shortly after midnight, capping days of often intense haggling and mounting pressure. The wording of some final pieces of the agreement need to be completed. The sprawling, 500-page-plus measure is the third coronavirus response bill produced by Congress and by far the largest. It builds on efforts focused on vaccines and emergency response, sick and family medical leave for workers, and food aid. It would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines. Hospitals would get significant help as well. McConnell, a key negotiator, said the package will “rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation's health care fight. And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help Americans workers, families, small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar.\"\" Five days of arduous talks produced the bill, creating tensions among Congress' top leaders, who each took care to tend to party politics as they maneuvered and battled over crafting the legislation. But failure was never an option, which permitted both sides to mark big wins. “That Washington drama does not matter any more,” McConnell said. “The Senate is going to stand together, act together, and pass this historic relief package today.” The bill would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year, and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child A huge cash infusion for hospitals expecting a flood of COVID-19 patients grew during the talks at Schumer's insistence. Republicans pressed for tens of billions of dollars for additional relief to be delivered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the lead federal disaster agency. Democrats said the package would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time. Schumer said businesses controlled by members of Congress and top administration officials — including Trump and his immediate family members — would be ineligible for the bill's business assistance. The New York Democrat immediately sent out a roster of negotiating wins for transit systems, hospital, and cash-hungry state governments that were cemented after Democrats blocked the measure in votes held Sunday and Monday to maneuver for such gains. But Cuomo said the Senate package would send less than $4 billion to New York, far short of his estimate that the crisis will cost his state up to $15 billion over the next year. More than 280 New Yorkers have died from the virus, a death toll more than double that of any other state. Pelosi was a force behind $400 million in grants to states to expand voting by mail and other steps that Democrats billed as making voting safer but Republican critics said was political opportunism. The package also contains $15.5 billion more for a surge in demand for food stamps. Republicans won inclusion of an “employee retention” tax credit that's estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50% of workers' paychecks. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax. A companion appropriations package ballooned as well, growing from a $46 billion White House proposal to more than $300 billion, which dwarfs earlier disasters — including Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy combined. To provide transparency, the package is expected to create a new inspector general and oversight board for the corporate dollars, much as was done during the 2008 bank rescue, officials said. Europe is enacting its own economic recovery packages, with huge amounts of credit guarantees, government spending and other support. Germany alone, Europe's biggest economy, has agreed to commit over 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion) in fiscal stimulus and support — roughly 30 percent of that nation's entire annual output. France, Spain and Italy have launched similar programs. The European Union has suspended limits it imposes on member countries' borrowing and deficits, freeing them to spend more. Some of Europe's fiscal stimulus kicks in automatically without any new legislation due to social welfare safety nets that are more extensive than in the U.S. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death. In the United States, more than 55,000 people have been sickened and more than 800 have died. \"",

The Democratic whip team is also figuring out a process for potential proxy voting, which would require a rule change but would mean fewer members have to return to the Capitol compared to a roll call vote. Still, a single member could object and demand a roll call vote. Pelosi has already advised her members that they may need to return to Washington, telling Democrats Wednesday that House leaders are talking to Capitol Police and the attending physician in preparation. House Republican leaders have privately acknowledged that there\'s a strong possibility that a member will object to a unanimous consent agreement. There has been plenty of last-minute drama with the Senate package. A furious New York Governor Andrew Cuomo held an emergency call with the House’s New York delegation at 11 a.m., where he told them “New York is dead"" and they needed to push for a stronger package, according to people familiar with the call. Cuomo later grew emotional during a press conference, lashing out at the Senate’s bill as “a drop in the bucket” for his state, which now has 30,611 coronavirus cases. Shortly after, Schumer, who represents New York and signed off on the bill, organized his own teleconference for his state’s delegation to help rally support for the bill. Still, Democrats have touted wins in the package, including $130 billion in funding for hospitals; a massive temporary expansion of unemployment benefits; federal oversight of a $500 billion fund to aid distressed industries; and a prohibition on access to loans or investments from the new programs to any of Trump’s personal businesses. Republican aides, however, accused Schumer of exaggerating some of his “wins” and countered that the GOP never objected to more money for hospitals or oversight of the $500 billion fund for corporations. Pelosi and other top Democrats have been fielding questions and complaints from their caucus in a series of calls Wednesday as rank-and-file Democrats complained that their priorities weren’t included in the Senate deal. Pelosi and her team reiterated that they will continue to fight for many of those proposals, noting there will be opportunities in the fourth stimulus bill Congress is all-but certain to craft. House Democrats are expected to be briefed on a full caucus call sometime after the Senate text is unveiled. ""This is not going to be the last bill,"" Pelosi said on PBS. ""This bill is about mitigation for the [economic] damage that is being done. … The next phase will be recovery."" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) blessed the deal in a statement Wednesday afternoon, and later told reporters at a press conference that he prefers a voice vote over a unanimous consent request. Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), who frequently objects to Congress’ biggest spending packages and isn’t beholden to party leadership, has also scoffed at the deal on Twitter, but signaled he won’t hold it up “if they have majorities to pass it.” Marianne LeVine contributed to this report."',
        AnswerContent: "\"Senate leaders raced to unravel last-minute snags Wednesday and win passage of an unparalleled $2 trillion economic rescue package steering aid to businesses, workers and health care systems engulfed by the coronavirus pandemic. The measure is the largest economic relief bill in history, and both parties' leaders were desperate for quick passage of a bill aimed at a virus that is costing lives and jobs by the hour. The package is intended as a weekslong or monthslong patch for an economy spiraling into recession or worse and a nation facing a grim toll from an infection that's killed nearly 20,000 people worldwide. Underscoring the effort's sheer magnitude, the bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion annual federal budget. \"\"A fight has arrived on our shores,\"\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \"\"We did not seek it, we did not want it, but now we're going to win it.\"\" \"\"Big help, quick help, is on the way,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. But the drive by leaders to speed the bill through the Senate was slowed as four conservative Republican senators demanded changes, saying the legislation as written “incentivizes layoffs\"\" and should be altered to ensure employees don't earn more money if they're laid off than if they're working. Complicating the standoff, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination has flagged, said he would block the bill unless the conservatives dropped their objections. Other objections floated in from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has become a prominent Democrat on the national scene as the country battles the pandemic. Cuomo, whose state has seen more deaths from the pandemic than any other, said: “I'm telling you, these numbers don't work.\"\" Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said the package “goes a long way.\"\" He said it will require strong oversight to ensure the wealthy don't benefit at the expense of workers and proposed forgiving at least $10,000 of student loan debt as part of the federal response. McConnell and Schumer hoped passage of the legislation in the Republican-led Senate would come by the end of the day. After a banner day on Tuesday as the package took shape, the stock market rallied even more on Wednesday. Senate passage would leave final congressional approval up to the Democratic-controlled House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the bipartisan agreement “takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people” but she stopped short of fully endorsing it. “House Democrats will now review the final provisions and legislative text of the agreement to determine a course of action,” she said. House members are scattered around the country and the timetable for votes in that chamber is unclear. House Democratic and Republican leaders have hoped to clear the measure for President Donald Trump's signature by a voice vote without having to call lawmakers back to Washington. But that may prove challenging, as the bill is sure to be opposed by some conservatives upset at its cost and scope. Ardent liberals were restless as well. White House aide Eric Ueland announced the agreement in a Capitol hallway Wednesday, shortly after midnight, capping days of often intense haggling and mounting pressure. The wording of some final pieces of the agreement need to be completed. The sprawling, 500-page-plus measure is the third coronavirus response bill produced by Congress and by far the largest. It builds on efforts focused on vaccines and emergency response, sick and family medical leave for workers, and food aid. It would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines. Hospitals would get significant help as well. McConnell, a key negotiator, said the package will “rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation's health care fight. And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help Americans workers, families, small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar.\"\" Five days of arduous talks produced the bill, creating tensions among Congress' top leaders, who each took care to tend to party politics as they maneuvered and battled over crafting the legislation. But failure was never an option, which permitted both sides to mark big wins. “That Washington drama does not matter any more,” McConnell said. “The Senate is going to stand together, act together, and pass this historic relief package today.” The bill would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year, and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child A huge cash infusion for hospitals expecting a flood of COVID-19 patients grew during the talks at Schumer's insistence. Republicans pressed for tens of billions of dollars for additional relief to be delivered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the lead federal disaster agency. Democrats said the package would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time. Schumer said businesses controlled by members of Congress and top administration officials — including Trump and his immediate family members — would be ineligible for the bill's business assistance. The New York Democrat immediately sent out a roster of negotiating wins for transit systems, hospital, and cash-hungry state governments that were cemented after Democrats blocked the measure in votes held Sunday and Monday to maneuver for such gains. But Cuomo said the Senate package would send less than $4 billion to New York, far short of his estimate that the crisis will cost his state up to $15 billion over the next year. More than 280 New Yorkers have died from the virus, a death toll more than double that of any other state. Pelosi was a force behind $400 million in grants to states to expand voting by mail and other steps that Democrats billed as making voting safer but Republican critics said was political opportunism. The package also contains $15.5 billion more for a surge in demand for food stamps. Republicans won inclusion of an “employee retention” tax credit that's estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50% of workers' paychecks. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax. A companion appropriations package ballooned as well, growing from a $46 billion White House proposal to more than $300 billion, which dwarfs earlier disasters — including Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy combined. To provide transparency, the package is expected to create a new inspector general and oversight board for the corporate dollars, much as was done during the 2008 bank rescue, officials said. Europe is enacting its own economic recovery packages, with huge amounts of credit guarantees, government spending and other support. Germany alone, Europe's biggest economy, has agreed to commit over 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion) in fiscal stimulus and support — roughly 30 percent of that nation's entire annual output. France, Spain and Italy have launched similar programs. The European Union has suspended limits it imposes on member countries' borrowing and deficits, freeing them to spend more. Some of Europe's fiscal stimulus kicks in automatically without any new legislation due to social welfare safety nets that are more extensive than in the U.S. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death. In the United States, more than 55,000 people have been sickened and more than 800 have died. \"",

To mollify those concerns, leaders have agreed to allow an amendment vote on the floor, according to sources familiar with the matter.

Still, Democrats have touted wins in the package, including $130 billion in funding for hospitals; a massive temporary expansion of unemployment benefits; federal oversight of a $500 billion fund to aid distressed industries; and a prohibition on access to loans or investments from the new programs to any of Trump’s personal businesses. Republican aides, however, accused Schumer of exaggerating some of his “wins” and countered that the GOP never objected to more money for hospitals or oversight of the $500 billion fund for corporations. Pelosi and other top Democrats have been fielding questions and complaints from their caucus in a series of calls Wednesday as rank-and-file Democrats complained that their priorities weren’t included in the Senate deal. Pelosi and her team reiterated that they will continue to fight for many of those proposals, noting there will be opportunities in the fourth stimulus bill Congress is all-but certain to craft. House Democrats are expected to be briefed on a full caucus call sometime after the Senate text is unveiled. ""This is not going to be the last bill,"" Pelosi said on PBS. ""This bill is about mitigation for the [economic] damage that is being done. … The next phase will be recovery."" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) blessed the deal in a statement Wednesday afternoon, and later told reporters at a press conference that he prefers a voice vote over a unanimous consent request. Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), who frequently objects to Congress’ biggest spending packages and isn’t beholden to party leadership, has also scoffed at the deal on Twitter, but signaled he won’t hold it up “if they have majorities to pass it.” Marianne LeVine contributed to this report."',
        AnswerContent: "\"Senate leaders raced to unravel last-minute snags Wednesday and win passage of an unparalleled $2 trillion economic rescue package steering aid to businesses, workers and health care systems engulfed by the coronavirus pandemic. The measure is the largest economic relief bill in history, and both parties' leaders were desperate for quick passage of a bill aimed at a virus that is costing lives and jobs by the hour. The package is intended as a weekslong or monthslong patch for an economy spiraling into recession or worse and a nation facing a grim toll from an infection that's killed nearly 20,000 people worldwide. Underscoring the effort's sheer magnitude, the bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion annual federal budget. \"\"A fight has arrived on our shores,\"\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \"\"We did not seek it, we did not want it, but now we're going to win it.\"\" \"\"Big help, quick help, is on the way,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. But the drive by leaders to speed the bill through the Senate was slowed as four conservative Republican senators demanded changes, saying the legislation as written “incentivizes layoffs\"\" and should be altered to ensure employees don't earn more money if they're laid off than if they're working. Complicating the standoff, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination has flagged, said he would block the bill unless the conservatives dropped their objections. Other objections floated in from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has become a prominent Democrat on the national scene as the country battles the pandemic. Cuomo, whose state has seen more deaths from the pandemic than any other, said: “I'm telling you, these numbers don't work.\"\" Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said the package “goes a long way.\"\" He said it will require strong oversight to ensure the wealthy don't benefit at the expense of workers and proposed forgiving at least $10,000 of student loan debt as part of the federal response. McConnell and Schumer hoped passage of the legislation in the Republican-led Senate would come by the end of the day. After a banner day on Tuesday as the package took shape, the stock market rallied even more on Wednesday. Senate passage would leave final congressional approval up to the Democratic-controlled House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the bipartisan agreement “takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people” but she stopped short of fully endorsing it. “House Democrats will now review the final provisions and legislative text of the agreement to determine a course of action,” she said. House members are scattered around the country and the timetable for votes in that chamber is unclear. House Democratic and Republican leaders have hoped to clear the measure for President Donald Trump's signature by a voice vote without having to call lawmakers back to Washington. But that may prove challenging, as the bill is sure to be opposed by some conservatives upset at its cost and scope. Ardent liberals were restless as well. White House aide Eric Ueland announced the agreement in a Capitol hallway Wednesday, shortly after midnight, capping days of often intense haggling and mounting pressure. The wording of some final pieces of the agreement need to be completed. The sprawling, 500-page-plus measure is the third coronavirus response bill produced by Congress and by far the largest. It builds on efforts focused on vaccines and emergency response, sick and family medical leave for workers, and food aid. It would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines. Hospitals would get significant help as well. McConnell, a key negotiator, said the package will “rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation's health care fight. And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help Americans workers, families, small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar.\"\" Five days of arduous talks produced the bill, creating tensions among Congress' top leaders, who each took care to tend to party politics as they maneuvered and battled over crafting the legislation. But failure was never an option, which permitted both sides to mark big wins. “That Washington drama does not matter any more,” McConnell said. “The Senate is going to stand together, act together, and pass this historic relief package today.” The bill would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year, and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child A huge cash infusion for hospitals expecting a flood of COVID-19 patients grew during the talks at Schumer's insistence. Republicans pressed for tens of billions of dollars for additional relief to be delivered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the lead federal disaster agency. Democrats said the package would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time. Schumer said businesses controlled by members of Congress and top administration officials — including Trump and his immediate family members — would be ineligible for the bill's business assistance. The New York Democrat immediately sent out a roster of negotiating wins for transit systems, hospital, and cash-hungry state governments that were cemented after Democrats blocked the measure in votes held Sunday and Monday to maneuver for such gains. But Cuomo said the Senate package would send less than $4 billion to New York, far short of his estimate that the crisis will cost his state up to $15 billion over the next year. More than 280 New Yorkers have died from the virus, a death toll more than double that of any other state. Pelosi was a force behind $400 million in grants to states to expand voting by mail and other steps that Democrats billed as making voting safer but Republican critics said was political opportunism. The package also contains $15.5 billion more for a surge in demand for food stamps. Republicans won inclusion of an “employee retention” tax credit that's estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50% of workers' paychecks. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax. A companion appropriations package ballooned as well, growing from a $46 billion White House proposal to more than $300 billion, which dwarfs earlier disasters — including Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy combined. To provide transparency, the package is expected to create a new inspector general and oversight board for the corporate dollars, much as was done during the 2008 bank rescue, officials said. Europe is enacting its own economic recovery packages, with huge amounts of credit guarantees, government spending and other support. Germany alone, Europe's biggest economy, has agreed to commit over 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion) in fiscal stimulus and support — roughly 30 percent of that nation's entire annual output. France, Spain and Italy have launched similar programs. The European Union has suspended limits it imposes on member countries' borrowing and deficits, freeing them to spend more. Some of Europe's fiscal stimulus kicks in automatically without any new legislation due to social welfare safety nets that are more extensive than in the U.S. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death. In the United States, more than 55,000 people have been sickened and more than 800 have died. \"",

        AnswerContent: '"Shortly after the Brooklyn Nets announced Tuesday that four players had tested positive for the coronavirus, Kevin Durant said he was one of the four. While the team did not identify the players in a news release, Durant spoke with The Athletic, saying he feels fine. ""Everyone be careful, take care of yourself and quarantine. We\'re going to get through this."" Brooklyn\'s announcement brings the NBA\'s publicly known cases of players who have tested positive for coronavirus to seven. Utah\'s Rudy Gobert was the first last week, which led the NBA to suspend the 2019-20 season. Gobert\'s teammate Donovan Mitchell and Detroit\'s Christian Wood also tested positive last week. The Nets have not played the Jazz or Pistons recently and have not played teams who have played the Jazz or Pistons since late February. ""The organization is currently notifying anyone who has had known contact with the players, including recent opponents, and is working closely with state and local health authorities on reporting,"" the Nets said in their statement. Durant has been out all season while recovering from surgery to repair a ruptured Achilles tendon he suffered in last year\'s NBA Finals. The Nets’ previous four games were against the Los Angeles Lakers on March 10, Chicago Bulls on March 8, San Antonio Spurs on March 6 and Memphis Grizzlies on March 4.

        ArticleContent: '"Four Brooklyn Nets players have tested positive for the coronavirus, the team announced Tuesday. The team didn’t identify which players had tested positive, only noting that three are asymptomatic and one player is exhibiting symptoms. The team said each player is isolated and under the care of a team doctors. “The organization is currently notifying anyone who has had known contact with the players, including recent opponents, and is working closely with state and local health authorities on reporting,” the team said in a statement. “All players and members of the Nets travel party are being asked to remain isolated, closely monitor their health and maintain constant communication with team medical staff. The health of our players and staff is of the highest priority to the organization and the team is doing everything within its power to ensure that those affected receive the best care possible.” Only three NBA players have tested positive for the virus -- Utah Jazz teammates Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell, and Detroit Pistons player Christian Wood. Brooklyn hadn’t played either team since January."',
        AnswerContent: '"Shortly after the Brooklyn Nets announced Tuesday that four players had tested positive for the coronavirus, Kevin Durant said he was one of the four. While the team did not identify the players in a news release, Durant spoke with The Athletic, saying he feels fine. ""Everyone be careful, take care of yourself and quarantine. We\'re going to get through this."" Brooklyn\'s announcement brings the NBA\'s publicly known cases of players who have tested positive for coronavirus to seven. Utah\'s Rudy Gobert was the first last week, which led the NBA to suspend the 2019-20 season. Gobert\'s teammate Donovan Mitchell and Detroit\'s Christian Wood also tested positive last week. The Nets have not played the Jazz or Pistons recently and have not played teams who have played the Jazz or Pistons since late February. ""The organization is currently notifying anyone who has had known contact with the players, including recent opponents, and is working closely with state and local health authorities on reporting,"" the Nets said in their statement. Durant has been out all season while recovering from surgery to repair a ruptured Achilles tendon he suffered in last year\'s NBA Finals. The Nets’ previous four games were against the Los Angeles Lakers on March 10, Chicago Bulls on March 8, San Antonio Spurs on March 6 and Memphis Grizzlies on March 4. The Nets initially welcomed Durant traveling with the team so he could support his teammates behind the scenes. Durant traveled with the Nets last week for their game against the Lakers.  Durant did not plan to travel with the Nets for their game behind closed doors against the Golden State Warriors at Chase Center. Even though the Warriors planned to play a tribute video for Durant, who helped them win two NBA championships in three Finals appearances.  That game was shelved when the NBA shut down after Gobert tested positive a day before the teams were scheduled to play.  OPINION: COVID-19 another gut punch to NBA\'s emotional season Durant sat on the Nets’ bench during their win against the Lakers at Staples Center and cheered throughout the game. When guard Spencer Dinwiddie made an 18-foot jumper to give the Nets a 104-102 lead with 28.4 seconds left, Durant approached him on the court and high-fived him. When officials rewarded the Lakers the ball after it went out of bounds with 5.8 seconds left, Durant talked with guard Caris LeVert about the final play. Throughout the game, Durant often sat next to center DeAndre Jordan and shared on-court observations. During morning shootaround, Nets interim coach Jacque Vaughn said Durant talked with him about the varying approaches defenders have taken in trying to guard him. Durant has remained selective with his itinerary while rehabbing. Otherwise, the Nets said Durant has mostly remained at the team’s facility for treatment. “The organization is currently notifying anyone who has had contact with the players, including recent opponents, and is working closely with state and local health authorities on reporting,” the Nets said in a statement. “All players and members of the Nets travel party are asked to remain isolated, closely monitor their health and maintain constant communication with team medical staff.”"',

        AnswerContent: '"Four members of the Brooklyn Nets, reportedly including Kevin Durant, have tested positive for the coronavirus, the team announced. Shams Charania of The Athletic reported that Durant, who has yet to play for the Nets while he recovers from a torn Achilles after signing with Brooklyn in the off-season, is among the four. Kevin Durant tested positive for coronavirus, Durant tells @TheAthleticNBA @Stadium. Durant says he is feeling fine: ""Everyone be careful, take care of yourself and quarantine. We\'re going to get through this."" — Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) March 17, 2020 ESPN\'s Adrian Wojnarowski was first to report the positive tests. Organization says it\'s notifying anyone who has had known contact with the players, including recent opponents. All Nets players and traveling party have been told to remain isolated. https://t.co/YG3WTQU1cS — Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn) March 17, 2020 Neither the team nor Wojnarowski identified the players who had tested positive. Among those recent opponents were the Boston Celtics, who played the Nets at TD Garden on March 3, losing 129-120 in overtime. The Celtics were also a recent opponent of the Utah Jazz, whose center Rudy Gobert, was the first NBA player to test positive for the virus, which led to the NBA to suspend its season and, subsequently, the suspension of all major sports seasons. R.I. child may have contracted virus through interaction with Jazz at Celtics game The Celtics played the Jazz three days before the Nets. After the NBA suspended its season on March 11, the Celtics said in a statement that it was unlikely that anyone from the team came into contact with infected Jazz players Gobert and teammate Donovan Mitchell while they were contagious. Celtics players were told to self-quarantine last weekend, at which time all players and staff that came into contact with the Jazz players were tested for the coronavirus, or more specifically, COVID-19. The players, like the rest of the country, have continued to stay in their homes this week. None of the Celtics had been showing symptoms, Chris Mannix of Sports Illustrated reported last week. The Nets said in a statement that one of the four players is “is exhibiting symptoms while three are asymptomatic. All four players are presently isolated and under the care of team physicians.” In the aftermath of Tom Brady’s sobering announcement that he’s moving on from the New England Patriots after two decades, is Celtics forward Jayson Tatum the new face of Boston’s sports? Probably. But he’s still got some work to do. See, it’s undeniable that, given the recent departures of Brady and Red Sox outfielder Mookie Betts, Tatum might be the most recognizable active All-Star in the region, at least among younger players with the potential to blossom even further. Easy there, Bruins fans, we’re well aware of the talent on your squad, and we’ll listen to your argument that David Pastrnak belongs in that conversation, too. NBA players are simply more recognizable than most helmet-clad athletes and the just-turned 22-year-old Tatum almost certainly has more facial recognition among casual observers. It helps, too, that, with a surge before the NBA season was suspended last week, Tatum muscled his way into the conversation about the future faces of the league, replete with a stamp of approval from LeBron James. Any young player truly looking to take over Brady’s throne, however, is missing one key ingredient: A championship. Given the absurd bar that local stars Brady, David Ortiz, and Paul Pierce set over the past two decades, you have to deliver banners and trophies before you can truly rule this city. It’s not quite enough anymore to simply be one of the best in your sport. What seems fair to suggest is that, with Tatum and Jaylen Brown as focal points, and especially with both players soon to be locked up deep into the future, the Celtics are best positioned among Boston’s big four for a long sustained run as championship contenders, at least based on each team\'s current core. Whether it’s Tatum, or Tatum and Brown, the door is open for Celtics youngsters to stake their claim to a vacant throne. Tatum and Brown, despite all the playoff success early in their careers, must still prove they can thrive on the big stage. It wasn’t just the rings that defined Ortiz and Brady, it was how they delivered in key moments. Look, it’s not easy to carve out a spot in the pantheon on Boston’s best athletes. Not when you see those pictures of Bill Russell struggling to hold his 11 championship rings, or Brady needing two hands to display all his Super Bowl jewelry. Even just taking the baton as the face of the region for a brief jog is a heavy crown to wear. But someone has to take it now and Tatum seems like the most obvious choice. Will it be his green No. 0 jersey that fills all of Boston’s sports venues? Will he be the sort of player that Boston fans roar for when he makes an offseason appearance at another team’s games? Much of that will hinge on what Tatum and the Celtics accomplish moving forward. A ring unlocks the full benefits of the throne. Until then, he’s simply the closest to the clasp. BOSTON — The coronavirus has put the NBA season on pause and in doing so, halted what has been an amazing season for Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum. Tatum has done more than just elevate his play to All-Star status. He has become a force in the NBA, putting up the kind of numbers that have him elbow-to-elbow statistically with some of the greatest to ever play in the NBA. Tatum turned 22 years old earlier this month, but prior to that he had five straight games with at least 25 points to become the youngest player in Celtics history to do so. He would soon break that record with a seven-game stretch in which he scored at least 25 points. Tatum also had a run in which he tallied 30 or more points over the course of five straight road games, a franchise record he shares with Larry Bird. In addition, Tatum’s five straight road games of 30-plus points also made him just the second player in NBA history (LeBron James is the other) to have such a road streak over the course of five games. So what does that mean if the season were to resume in the coming weeks or months? Based on what Tatum has done and the potential he has shown to do more, it’s not a huge stretch to envision him finishing the season in the conversation as a top-10, top-15 player. When you look at the ease at which he scores, the level of defense that he’s playing at more consistently and of course the Celtics being among the top three or so teams in the East, it adds up to a player who\'s on the short list of upper-echelon talent in the NBA. And as we’ve seen throughout the course of the league, teams that win titles typically do so with at least one top-10 caliber talent. Kemba Walker is a four-time All-Star and was a starter in last month’s All-Star game. And while he’s working his way back from a sore left knee, even at full strength you would be hard-pressed to consider him a top-10 player. He’s still one of the best in the NBA, mind you. But Tatum’s play and undeniable potential put him on a different level of greatness, the kind that gives the Celtics real hope that a Tatum-led future will someday bring home Banner 18. "',

Durant says he is feeling fine: ""Everyone be careful, take care of yourself and quarantine.

That Durant, who has not played for the Nets this season as he recovers from a torn Achilles, was one of the guys who tested positive shows it had worked its way through the team. Durant has worked out with the team, coaches, and players getting less run on the court, but he had not played in an NBA game. Kevin Durant has progressed to 4-on-4 in his rehab. Here he takes rookie Nic Claxton off the dribble. First time I’ve seen Kevin Durant dunking since his injury. This confirms that KD is in LA with the Nets for start of their west coast trip.pic.twitter.com/fXUgtkGjVQ — Billy Reinhardt (@BillyReinhardt) March 10, 2020 There has been speculation Durant could join the Nets for the playoffs if they are pushed back to May or later (as appears most likely), but Durant’s friend and business partner tamped down those expectations. The Nets paid for a private testing firm to check on their players, not drawing down the limited supply of tests in New York and nationwide for public testing. Any doctor or medical professional who came forward with the names of the players who tested positive would be violating HIPAA (the patient privacy law), however Durant came forward of his own volition."',

        AnswerContent: '"Results of a new preliminary study from China have stated that people with Type-A blood are more vulnerable to coronavirus.

""ABO group in 3694 normal people in Wuhan showed a distribution of 32.16%, 24.90%, 9.10% and 33.84% for A, B, AB and O,"" says the study. This showed that people with Type-A blood are the most common in Wuhan while people with Type-O blood are the least common. More results were deduced when the healthy samples were compared with people infected with the virus. According to the study, among the 1,775 patients studied in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, 37.75 percent were Type-A and 9.10 percent were Type-O. This meant Type-A blood was most common among patients infected with the coronavirus while Type-O blood was the least common. Among the 206 patients who died from the virus, 41.26 percent, had Type A-blood. While only around 25 percent of the deaths were of people with Type-O blood. The observations from the study stated that the proportion of people with Type- A blood infected or killed by the virus was found to be much higher than other blood groups. It also clearly demonstrated that in comparison to other blood groups the proportion of people with Type-O blood infected or killed by the virus was lower. ""People of blood group A might need particularly strengthened personal protection to reduce the chance of infection,"" wrote the researchers at the Centre for Evidence-Based and Translational Medicine based out of Wuhan, according to the New York Post.

The team leader Wang Xinghuan has said that the study is just ""preliminary"" and more research needs to be done before concrete results can be observed.

        ArticleContent: '"A study revealed that people with blood type A had higher chances to develop more severe symptoms People with blood type O “had a significantly lower risk for the infectious disease"" “If you are type A, there is no need to panic. It does not mean you will be infected 100 percent,"" a scientist said A recent study in China stated that there were more possibilities that people with blood type A could get coronavirus when compared to the other blood groups. For the study, the researchers took blood group patterns of over 2,000 patients infected with coronavirus in Wuhan and Shenzhen and compared it with “normal people from the corresponding regions.” It was revealed that people with blood type A were more vulnerable to infection and had higher chances to develop more severe symptoms. “People of blood group A might need particularly strengthened personal protection to reduce the chance of infection,” the researchers wrote, adding, “Sars-CoV-2-infected patients with blood group A might need to receive more vigilant surveillance and aggressive treatment.” On the other hand, people with blood type O “had a significantly lower risk for the infectious disease compared with non-O blood groups.” “It might be helpful to introduce ABO blood typing in both patients and medical personnel as a routine part of the management of Sars-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections, to help define the management options and assess risk exposure levels of people,” the research paper stated. Meanwhile, speaking to South China Morning Post, scientists who were not involved with the study said more sample size was required to “guide medical practices.” “If you are type A, there is no need to panic. It does not mean you will be infected 100 per cent. If you are type O, it does not mean you are absolutely safe, either. You still need to wash your hands and follow the guidelines issued by authorities,” Gao Yingdai, a researcher with the State Key Laboratory of Experimental Haematology in Tianjin, said."',
        AnswerContent: '"Results of a new preliminary study from China have stated that people with Type-A blood are more vulnerable to coronavirus. The same study has concluded that people with Type-O blood could be more resistant to coronavirus. Researchers conducted this study at two hospitals in Wuhan, the place of origin of the coronavirus outbreak, and one hospital in Shenzhen, China. The study compared blood types of 2,173 patients, who were confirmed positive for COVID-19 using the SARS-CoV-2 test, with more than 3,694 healthy inhabitants of Wuhan. ""A total of 1,775 patients with COVID-19, including 206 dead cases, from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China were recruited. Another 113 and 285 patients with COVID-19 were respectively recruited from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan and Shenzhen Third People\'s Hospital, Shenzhen, China,"" says the study. ""ABO group in 3694 normal people in Wuhan showed a distribution of 32.16%, 24.90%, 9.10% and 33.84% for A, B, AB and O,"" says the study. This showed that people with Type-A blood are the most common in Wuhan while people with Type-O blood are the least common. More results were deduced when the healthy samples were compared with people infected with the virus. According to the study, among the 1,775 patients studied in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, 37.75 percent were Type-A and 9.10 percent were Type-O. This meant Type-A blood was most common among patients infected with the coronavirus while Type-O blood was the least common. Among the 206 patients who died from the virus, 41.26 percent, had Type A-blood. While only around 25 percent of the deaths were of people with Type-O blood. The observations from the study stated that the proportion of people with Type- A blood infected or killed by the virus was found to be much higher than other blood groups. It also clearly demonstrated that in comparison to other blood groups the proportion of people with Type-O blood infected or killed by the virus was lower. ""People of blood group A might need particularly strengthened personal protection to reduce the chance of infection,"" wrote the researchers at the Centre for Evidence-Based and Translational Medicine based out of Wuhan, according to the New York Post. ""If you are type A, there is no need to panic. It does not mean you will be infected 100 percent,"" Gao Yingdai, a researcher in the city of Tianjin, told the daily. ""If you are type O, it does not mean you are absolutely safe, either. You still need to wash your hands and follow the guidelines issued by authorities,"" added Yingdai.

        AnswerContent: "\"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) - A Norwegian running in only his second Iditarod has a commanding lead as mushers enter the final stretch of this year’s sled dog race across Alaska, one of the few U.S. sports not canceled over fears of the new coronavirus. Thomas Waerner was the first musher to reach the checkpoint in White Mountain, Alaska, just after 5:30 a.m. Tuesday. White Mountain is the second-to-last checkpoint, and where mushers must take a mandatory eight-hour rest before navigating the treacherous and windswept icy Bering Sea coastline the last 77 miles (124 kilometers) to the finish line in Nome. TOP STORIES America, with coronavirus, gets a taste of socialism 'Inducing panic': Media under fire for driving coronavirus hype to epidemic levels White House pitching massive coronavirus relief bill to Congress Wearner noted that four-time champion Jeff Kijng was also set up well at this point of the race in 2014, until a blizzard caused King to scratch close to Nome. ”It’s never over before it’s over, but it looks pretty good,” Waerner, 46, said in a video posted to the Iditarod website. GPS tracking on the Iditarod website showed the nearest musher to Waerner was three-time champion Mitch Seavey, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) behind him on the trail to White Mountain. Chasing the leaders were Jessie Royer of Fairbanks, Brent Sass of Eureka and Aaron Burmeister of Nome. Wearner, who lives in Torpa, Norway, first ran the Iditarod in 2015, when he finished in 17th place and earned Rookie of the Year honors. In 2019, he won the 745-mile (1,200-kilometer) Finnmarkslopet, the longest sled dog race in Europe. The Iditarod began March 8 just north of Anchorage for 57 mushers, the second smallest field in two decades. They crossed two mountain ranges and mushed on the frozen Yukon River before reaching the Bering Sea. Since the race started, nine mushers have withdrawn from the race. Fears over the new coronavirus prompted big changes along the trail for race officials. They asked fans not to fly to Nome for the finish after the city, like many in Alaska, closed public buildings. In some other villages, which serve as checkpoints along the nearly 1,000-mile (1,600-kilometer) course, official check-in points were moved outside the communities to limit contact. In one case, the checkpoint was held on the Yukon River. An animal welfare group took credit for two sponsors with Alaska ties announcing they would drop sponsorship. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals claims more than 150 dogs have died horrible deaths running the Iditarod since it began in 1973. The Iditarod disputes that number but has declined to provide its own count despite numerous requests by The Associated Press. Alaska Airlines announced before the race started it would end its four decade long financial support, citing a change in the company’s corporate giving strategy. On Monday, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said its Anchorage Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram dealership would no longer sponsor the race. PETA pressures race sponsors to drop out, often conducting protests outside corporate headquarters, like it says it did in Seattle at the airline and in Detroit for the automaker. The Anchorage dealership was one of the Iditarod’s top-tier sponsors and has for 30 years provided a large chunk of the winner’s prize, a new pickup. Officials have not announced the amount of this year’s purse, but the cash prizes have shrunk the last few years. Seavey won $71,250 for winning the 2017 race, while 2019 champion Pete Kaiser only received $51,299. “This is a money-spending sport,” Waerner joked when accepting the $2,500 check from a sponsor Monday. \"",

White Mountain is the second-to-last checkpoint, and where mushers must take a mandatory eight-hour rest before navigating the treacherous and windswept icy Bering Sea coastline the last 77 miles (124 kilometers) to the finish line in Nome. TOP STORIES America, with coronavirus, gets a taste of socialism 'Inducing panic': Media under fire for driving coronavirus hype to epidemic levels White House pitching massive coronavirus relief bill to Congress Wearner noted that four-time champion Jeff Kijng was also set up well at this point of the race in 2014, until a blizzard caused King to scratch close to Nome. ”It’s never over before it’s over, but it looks pretty good,” Waerner, 46, said in a video posted to the Iditarod website. GPS tracking on the Iditarod website showed the nearest musher to Waerner was three-time champion Mitch Seavey, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) behind him on the trail to White Mountain. Chasing the leaders were Jessie Royer of Fairbanks, Brent Sass of Eureka and Aaron Burmeister of Nome. Wearner, who lives in Torpa, Norway, first ran the Iditarod in 2015, when he finished in 17th place and earned Rookie of the Year honors. In 2019, he won the 745-mile (1,200-kilometer) Finnmarkslopet, the longest sled dog race in Europe. The Iditarod began March 8 just north of Anchorage for 57 mushers, the second smallest field in two decades. They crossed two mountain ranges and mushed on the frozen Yukon River before reaching the Bering Sea. Since the race started, nine mushers have withdrawn from the race. Fears over the new coronavirus prompted big changes along the trail for race officials. They asked fans not to fly to Nome for the finish after the city, like many in Alaska, closed public buildings. In some other villages, which serve as checkpoints along the nearly 1,000-mile (1,600-kilometer) course, official check-in points were moved outside the communities to limit contact. In one case, the checkpoint was held on the Yukon River. An animal welfare group took credit for two sponsors with Alaska ties announcing they would drop sponsorship. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals claims more than 150 dogs have died horrible deaths running the Iditarod since it began in 1973. The Iditarod disputes that number but has declined to provide its own count despite numerous requests by The Associated Press. Alaska Airlines announced before the race started it would end its four decade long financial support, citing a change in the company’s corporate giving strategy. On Monday, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said its Anchorage Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram dealership would no longer sponsor the race. PETA pressures race sponsors to drop out, often conducting protests outside corporate headquarters, like it says it did in Seattle at the airline and in Detroit for the automaker. The Anchorage dealership was one of the Iditarod’s top-tier sponsors and has for 30 years provided a large chunk of the winner’s prize, a new pickup. Officials have not announced the amount of this year’s purse, but the cash prizes have shrunk the last few years. Seavey won $71,250 for winning the 2017 race, while 2019 champion Pete Kaiser only received $51,299. “This is a money-spending sport,” Waerner joked when accepting the $2,500 check from a sponsor Monday. \"",

        ArticleContent: '"Joe Biden swept all three primaries on Tuesday night in Arizona, Florida and Illinois, CBS News projects. The contests took place amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis that led Ohio officials to postpone their primary, which had also been scheduled for Tuesday. In remarks after his early win in Florida, Biden, speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, said his campaign appeared to have had a ""very good night,"" but he also spoke about the coronavirus crisis. He told Americans that ""it\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy."" Bernie Sanders gave remarks via livestream earlier in the night. He focused mainly on the coronavirus crisis and highlighted unity. Tuesday\'s lopsided results will expand the divide in delegates between Biden and Sanders. It\'s unclear when the next primary contests will be held. Georgia, which had been set to vote on March 24, has postponed its primary, as did Louisiana, which was scheduled to go to the polls on April 4. As of 12 a.m. ET on Wednesday, Biden had increased his lead to 291 delegates. Biden now has 1,093 delegates to Sanders\' 802. To get the nomination, the Democratic candidate will need 1,991 delegates. According to CBS News primary polling in Arizona, the most important candidate quality for voters was being able to unite the country. Of those voters, 65% said they voted for Biden, while just 16% went for Sanders. The poll was mostly of voters who already voted by mail and includes those who said they were likely to show up at polls today. Like Florida and Illinois voters, 69% of Arizona voters saw Biden as the candidate with the best chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to 26% who believed the same of Sanders. Biden was also seen as the candidate trusted more to handle a major crisis. Biden led among white voters by 51% to 32%. Hispanic voters were more evenly divided: Biden 45% to Sanders 44%. CBS News projects the former vice president wins the Arizona primary, finalizing Biden\'s sweep of the three states that voted. Sixty-seven pledged delegates are up for grabs in Arizona. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose cheered the decision to postpone the state\'s primary election until June 2, saying it ""saved Ohio lives."" ""By preventing Ohioans from going to polling locations, we averted a situation which would have gone against the most recent scientific evidence available and could have dangerously advanced the spread of coronavirus across Ohio,"" the two said in a joining statement. ""It is abundantly clear that it would have been impossible to carry out a fair, accessible, and safe election today."" DeWine and LaRose stressed that Ohio voters should have a ""significant"" amount of time to cast mail-in absentee ballots and also vote in-person. Less than 12 hours before the polls were set to open in Ohio, DeWine announced that Dr. Amy Acton, director of the Ohio Department of Health, would be issuing an order to close polls ""to avoid the imminent threat with the high probability of widespread exposure to COVID-19."" As of 11 p.m. ET, Biden is leading in every county in Florida. Although Hillary Clinton won the primary in 2016, Sanders won nine counties in the northern part of the state in that contest. The Arizona secretary of state has revealed that personal information related to some protected voters was erroneously included in reports generated from the state\'s voter registration database. Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said in a statement that the error was not the result of a security breach or vulnerability. Hobbs said her office was notified from a county official that an early ballot report they compiled included ""protected voters,"" or those whose information is protected due to their jobs or if they were victims of certain crimes. Seventy-eight names were mistakenly included in the reports, the secretary of state\'s office said, and the office has asked county officials to contact those who were directly impacted. The early ballot reports are produced using data from the state\'s voter registration database, and the reports are provided by counties to political parties during elections. Hobb\'s office said the process for producing reports from the voter registration database has also been updated to prevent future errors. Biden celebrated his early wins in Illinois and Florida with a solemn address to supporters calling for the country to come together in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, while also thanking Bernie Sanders and his supporters for the ""remarkable passion"" they have brought to the Democratic race. Speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, with a backdrop of black cloth and flanked by two American flags, Biden remarked that his campaign ""has had a very good night"" and is moving closer to securing the Democratic presidential nomination. He also thanked election officials and poll workers in the three states with in-person voting for ensuring people could cast their ballots while also remaining safe. ""It\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy,"" he said. Biden said that his campaign is building a broad coalition that includes support from African-Americans, the Latino community, labor, firefighters, teachers, suburban women and others. ""We\'re doing it with a common vision,"" he said, adding that he and Sanders share that vision. The former vice president also thanked Sanders and his supporters for bringing ""remarkable passion and tenacity"" to issues like healthcare, income inequality and climate change, and delivered a message directly to young Sanders supporters. ""To young votes who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you, I know what\'s at stake. I know what we have to do,"" he said. ""Our goal as a campaign and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party and to unify the nation."" Biden also praised Americans for altering their lives as public health officials rush to limit the spread of the coronavirus, saying that Americans are ""ordinary people doing extraordinary things when the need arises and today we are moving quickly to adapt our routines to meet this challenge."" ""It\'s in moments like these we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans,"" Biden said. ""The coronavirus doesn\'t care if you\'re a Democrat or Republican. It will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender or your zip code. It will touch people in positions of power as well as the most vulnerable people in our society. We\'re all in this together."" A large number of likely voters in Illinois, 87%, said they were concerned about coronavirus, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to the primary. Biden received the support of likely voters concerned about the coronavirus by about 2-to-1. Similar percentages of likely voters are worried about the direction of the nation\'s economy in 2021, and Biden received their support by a similar margin. Sixty-four percent of likely voters in the Illinois primary picked Biden over Sanders as the person they would trust more to handle a major crisis. Likely primary voters in Illinois said beating President Trump was more important to them than having a candidate who agreed with them on the issues, and 69% said Biden would have the better chance to defeat the incumbent president in November. Polling shows Biden with a commanding lead among black likely voters – getting 70% of those polled – but he also received a majority vote of white likely voters as well, securing the support of both whites with and without college degrees. He received the support of over half of men and nearly two-thirds of women. The generational divide seen throughout this election cycle was also apparent in Illinois, with Sanders taking the vast majority of likely voters under 45, and Biden getting the strong support among older voters. But older likely voters significantly outnumbered their younger counterparts: more than six in ten likely voters were over the age of 45. And while Sanders maintains strong support of likely voters who say they are very liberal – getting nearly two-thirds support among this group – they made up just over a quarter of those polled. Biden garnered strong support among likely voters who said they were ""somewhat liberal"", and did particularly well among moderates. CBS News estimates Illinois leans toward Biden. At the moment, Chicago looks to be very close between Biden and Sanders, but many more votes are expected to be counted. The current delegate allocation in Illinois has Biden with 33 delegates and Sanders with 21. There are 155 total delegates at stake in Illinois. Following wins in the Republican primaries in Illinois and Florida, President Trump has secured the delegates needed to win the Republican presidential nomination, CBS News projects. President Trump has clinched the Republican nomination.https://t.co/E3KhCZjESV pic.twitter.com/YNT7WliBd0 — CBS News (@CBSNews) March 18, 2020 Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel offered congratulations to Mr. Trump for ""officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for president."" Congratulations to Donald J. Trump on officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for President! His home state of Florida just delivered him the delegates he needed. Our party is united, our grassroots movement is fired up, and we are ready for FOUR MORE YEARS! pic.twitter.com/B4X9IaQp7f — Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) March 18, 2020 Mr. Trump had several early challengers for the Republican nomination, though most dropped out of the race. Only former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld remains in the race. Most likely voters in Florida said electability was a priority for them going into the primary, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to March 17. Seventy-three percent of likely voters also think Biden would have a good chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to just 21% who picked Sanders. Voters over age 45 were more likely to say they support Biden. Those who want the next president to return to Obama policies instead of more liberal policies said they would vote for Biden. Nearly half of Florida likely voters said Sanders\' issue positions were too liberal, but most said Biden\'s issue positions were about right. Florida likely voters said they trusted Biden over Sanders by a wide margin — 59% to 37% — to handle Social Security. anders addressed supporters in a livestreamed speech after polls closed in most of Florida and called for the country to come together as local, state and federal officials respond to the coronavirus. ""I think the main point to be made tonight is that in this moment of crisis, it is imperative that we stand together, understand that right now throughout this country, there are so many of our people wondering what\'s going to happen to me tomorrow?"" Sanders said. He added that ""this is a moment that we have got to be working together."" Sanders laid out a series of proposals he said he plans to present to Democratic leadership and said an adequate response will require an ""unprecedented"" amount of money."" Sanders estimated the price tag will top $2 trillion. The plans put forth by Sanders to bolster the response to the coronavirus include allowing Medicare to cover all medical bills during the public health crisis; increasing test kits for the coronavirus and the speed at which tests are processed; activating the National Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other military resources to help expand healthcare capacity; and using emergency authority to scale up production in the U.S. of critical supplies and protective equipment. Sanders also suggested a number of measures to mitigate the economic impacts for American workers and their families, including providing a $2,000 monthly cash payment to every household for the duration of the crisis, expanding Meals on Wheels and food stamps and placing a moratorium on evictions, foreclosures and utility shutoffs. ""We must make certain that the government is getting this money into the hands of working families and the most vulnerable as quickly as possible,"" he said. Sanders said the economic crisis should not be ""another money-making opportunity"" for large corporations and Wall Street. ""We\'ve got some major crisis, but I have the strong belief that if we work together, if we do not turn to fear and panic, but if we understand that the way we solve this is by going forward as one people, remembering those who are hurting tonight and will be hurting in the future,"" he said. ""This is the richest country in the history world. This is a country with unbelievable energy, with unbelievable talent, with incredible resources. We can do it. We can address this crisis, we can minimize the pain and let us do just that."" CBS News projects Biden will win Florida, the biggest prize in Tuesday\'s primaries with 219 pledged delegates. Florida has a large Hispanic population, and Biden has previously struggled to gain support from Hispanic voters in states which have already held primaries, like Nevada. The delegate allocation at poll closing in Florida was 100 delegates for Biden, and 27 for Sanders, according to CBS News\' analysis. All polls are now closed in Florida and in Illinois, after an election day marked by fears about the spread of the coronavirus. Polls close in Arizona at 10 p.m. ET. The Ohio primary has been pushed back until June 2. Sanders will livestream remarks about the coronavirus crisis at 7:15 p.m., shortly after polls close in Florida. The speech will address how the ""response to the outbreak should put working families and the most vulnerable first,"" according to a press release from the campaign. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democrats said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Biden and Sanders have made remarks outlining their plans to respond to the crisis. The Florida Democratic Party said the number of Democrats who have voted early in person and by mail has exceeded turnout in the primaries in 2016. According to the state party, 141,560 more Democrats voted by mail this year than they did in the last presidential primary. Additionally, 74,031 more Democrats voted early in person this year than in 2016. The Florida Democratic Party also said it enrolled nearly 500,000 new Democrats into vote-by-mail in 2018. The party said that the coronavirus pandemic, which has impacted voting in states holding their contests today, demonstrates the need for the government to revamp voting methods. As the country deals with a health care crisis, the issue of health care remains on voters\' minds. In Arizona, Florida, and Illinois, voters picked health care as the issue that would be most important in determining their vote, according to CBS News primary polls. The second most important issue among voters in each of the three states was income inequality, followed by climate change and race relations. Likely Democratic voters in Illinois said they are also worried about the economy, primary polls show. More than eight in 10 are least somewhat concerned about the national economy over the next year. In the three states where voters will head to the polls Tuesday, most said they prefer the Democratic nominee be someone who can beat Trump — at least six in 10 in each state— over someone they agree with on major issues, according to CBS News primary polls. As has been the case throughout this campaign, there are high levels of dissatisfaction toward the Trump administration among the Democratic primary electorate. Large majorities of likely voters in Florida and Illinois and those who voted by mail in Arizona said they feel angry about the Trump administration. Among likely Democratic voters in Illinois, more Sanders supporters said they would be unhappy about Biden being the nominee than Biden supporters would be if Sanders became the nominee, according to primary polls. Fifty-four percent of Sanders supporters would be dissatisfied or upset if Biden won the nomination, compared to 37% of Biden backers who would feel that way if Sanders became the nominee. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democratic voters said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Among those polled in Florida, 71% said they trusted Biden more, compared to 23% who said Sanders is the candidate they trust to handle a major crisis. In Illinois, 64% of Democratic voters selected Biden while 31% said Sanders is more trusted, and in Arizona, 63% said they trust Biden more to handle a major crisis compared to 31%, who pointed to Sanders. The Democratic National Committee is calling on states that haven\'t yet held their primaries to vote by mail, as coronavirus threatens future primaries. ""The simplest tool is vote by mail, which is already in use in a number of states and should be made available to all registered voters. States using vote by mail should proactively mail ballots to registered voters, where feasible, and should count all ballots as long as they are postmarked by the date of the primary,"" DNC chair Tom Perez said in a statement on Wednesday. Where in-person voting can take place in accordance with health guidelines, states should expand the days and hours of early voting to cut down on lines, Perez added. According to CBS News primary polls, nearly all likely voters in Illinois expressed at least some concern about the effects of the coronavirus, including more than half who said they are very concerned about it. Most likely voters of all ages in Illinois said they are concerned, but older voters are particularly so: 62% of voters ages 45 and over say they are very concerned, compared to 38% of younger voters. Women (59%) were also more likely than men (46%) to be very concerned. Some voters, meanwhile, said the coronavirus could change their decision to vote. In Florida, among those who said they would definitely vote and planned to do so in person on Election Day, 15% said it was very or somewhat likely that they could change their decision to vote. In Illinois, that figure was 9%, according to primary polls. The Biden campaign is optimistic it will walk away from Tuesday\'s primaries with a wider delegate lead than it had going into the contests despite the challenges to voter turnout raised because of the coronavirus. ""It would take a drastic, historically-incomparable swing for Senator Sanders to win more delegates than Biden today or to close the delegate differential,"" the campaign said in a memo released Tuesday. Heading into the four primaries held on Tuesday, Biden led Sanders by more than 100 delegates. The former vice president\'s campaign also noted that while fewer people may head to the polls on Election Day because of the coronavirus, it expects overall turnout to match that of past elections. ""While voter turnout on Election Day itself may be lower due to COVID-19 concerns, we believe that, with early vote and vote by mail, overall turnout will be roughly on pace for 2016 in Arizona and Florida and roughly on pace for 2018 in Illinois, and that voter turnout in all three states will reflect the population at large,"" the campaign said in the memo. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, on Tuesday defended the decision to keep the polls open despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. ""There are people out there today who want to say, \'Oh, it\'s a crisis, bend the rules and overstep your authority,\'"" Pritzker said. ""Let me tell you this, It is exactly in times like these, when the constitutional boundaries of our democracy should be respected above all else. And if people want to criticize me for that, well, go ahead. I\'ll wear it like a badge of honor."" Earlier Tuesday, Chicago Board of Elections spokesman Jim Allen said he urged Pritzker to prohibit voting in person and go fully vote-by-mail. Allen later apologized for the remarks. The Chicago Board of Elections said they said they\'ve had to move in total 200 precincts, with some locations in the city dropping out as soon as this morning (these cases were immediately moved to a new location). In Chicago, 126,499 votes have been cast through 2 p.m. ET, with a surge after the first two hours. Biden tweeted a reminder about polls being open in Arizona, Florida and Illinois. ""I encourage folks to vote by mail or curbside vote if you can,"" Biden wrote. ""If you vote in person, please wash your hands, don\'t touch your face, and stay 6\' from others in line."" Maryland Governor Larry Hogan announced at a press conference on Tuesday morning that the state will move its primary from April 28 until June 2. The state Board of Elections issued a statement shortly after that ""fully supports"" Hogan\'s decision. The decision follows similar action in Georgia, Kentucky and Louisiana. In a last-minute move on Monday, Ohio postponed its primary. The Ohio State Supreme Court denied a challenge to Ohio\'s primary delay filed by Wood County judicial candidate Corey Speweik, who was fighting the state of Ohio\'s decision to shut down Tuesday\'s primary and postpone voting until June over concern about the spread of the coronavirus. The process leading up to the delay was chaotic. With less than 12 hours to go before polls were scheduled to open in Ohio for the state\'s presidential primary election, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, announced polls would remain closed Tuesday amid concerns over the coronavirus. The decision came just hours after a Franklin County judge denied a request backed by the governor and secretary of state to delay the election. The Ohio Democratic Party said in a statement Tuesday that although voting did not seem feasible, it hoped the primary would be rescheduled for earlier than June 2. ""Given the chaos, confusion and mixed messages of the past 24 hours, it\'s clearly impossible for in-person voting to move forward today in Ohio,"" the party said in a statement. ""The Ohio Democratic Party strongly supports concluding the primary election earlier than June 2. Extending for that long is highly problematic for any number for reasons, and it is not at all clear that in-person voting will be possible on that date anyway,"" the statement continued. At a news conference Monday, in response to a question about the possible impact of the coronavirus outbreak, President Trump said delaying elections would be ""not a very good thing."" ""I\'d leave that up to the states,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Postponing elections is not a very good thing … I think postponing is unnecessary."" A poll by Monmouth University released on Monday showed Biden with a double-digit advantage over Sanders in Arizona. Among voters likely to participate in the primary, Biden was supported by 51% to Sanders\' 31%. Sanders leads among Latino voters by seven points, and among voters under 50 years old by wide margins. But this is more than offset by Biden\'s strong advantage among larger voter blocs, including white voters and those aged 50 and over. In head-to-head matchups with the president, Biden had a small edge Mr. Trump, but the president was virtually tied with Sanders. Although Arizona has long been a solid red state, it could be a battleground this November. Mr. Trump only won the state by 4 points against Hillary Clinton in 2016. In the Senate race, Democrat Mark Kelly had a 6-point edge in the poll over incumbent Martha McSally. "',
        AnswerContent: '"Check back for updates as polls close in three states amid the coronavirus pandemic. Former Vice President Joe Biden swept all three states voting Tuesday in a series of primaries that were heavily influenced by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. His last win of the night came in Arizona, where the Associated Press projected a victory through voter surveys. Biden secured early projected wins in Florida and Illinois, where he was long heavily favored to win, and he captured the state of Arizona shortly after polls there closed at 10 p.m. EDT. In all, more than 440 delegates were up for grabs in the latest round of voting, and Biden’s projected victories handed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders a formidable challenge to catch up. It was the first series of primaries to take place amid the national state of emergency President Donald Trump declared over the coronavirus pandemic, a circumstance that had the potential to upend the candidates’ messages as well as the technical process of running a primary election. The Democratic primary schedule has a bit of a lull for the next month. Puerto Rico holds a primary March 29. April 4 primaries include Hawaii with 24 delegates, Alaska with 15 and Wyoming’s caucuses with 14. Wisconsin has a primary April 7. And then on April 28, five states will make their choices, including New York with 274 delegates and Pennsylvania with 186 delegates. Ohioans were set to cast their ballots on Tuesday but state officials there announced they would postpone the election until sometime after the outbreak had passed. “This pandemic has impacted every aspect of our lives, and every aspect of this campaign,” Biden said in a video streamed from his home in Delaware, where he eschewed the traditional rally to deliver his election night remarks. “It’s at moments like these that we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans.” Both candidates avoided attacks on each other, or even discussing the latest contours of the race.    “In this moment of crisis it is imperative that we stand together,” Sanders said in his own video message. “This is a moment that we’ve got to be working together.” Heading into the election, Biden had a better than 153-delegate lead over Sanders.    Trump, who never faced a significant challenge, also swept the primaries Tuesday and exceeded the 1,276 delegates needed to become the GOP’s presumptive nominee. As Arizona’s polls closed Tuesday with uncertain results, former Vice President Joe Biden looked to add to his Democratic primary wins in Florida and Illinois against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, according to Associated Press projections from voter surveys. Biden’s victories came on the same night President Donald Trump locked up the Republican nomination for his re-election. Biden said from his home in Wilmington, Del., that the victories demonstrated a broad coalition to beat Trump, including blacks, Hispanics, suburban women and veterans. He commended Sanders’ supporters and said they share a vision for affordable health care, a need to reduce income inequality and to fight climate change. “Sen. Sanders and I may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision,” Biden said. “Sen. Sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all of these issues.” Florida offered the biggest prize for Biden, with 219 pledged delegates. At stake in Illinois were 155 delegates and in Arizona were 67 delegates. Ohio, with 136 delegates, postponed its vote because of concerns about coronavirus. The virus declared a worldwide pandemic wreaked havoc with the primaries in all three states, according to voting advocates. Poll workers failed to show up to work. Election officials closed polling places for lack of staff and to move them away from residential facilities for the elderly. And workers lacked wipes and hand sanitizer to reduce the spread of disease. “This pandemic has impacted every aspect of our life, and every aspect of this campaign,” Biden said. “Tackling this pandemic is a national emergency akin to fighting a war.” But the victories built on Biden’s lead toward meeting the 1,991 delegates needed to clinch the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. Biden had at least 1,121 delegates, compared to 839 for Sanders, according to an AP tabulation. Political experts say the remaining states offer little chance for Sanders to make large enough strides to overtake Biden. For example, the Florida win continued Biden’s successful march across the south, after South Carolina revived his campaign Feb. 29. He swept southern states on March 3 Super Tuesday. Still ahead are Georgia May 19 and Louisiana on June 20. The Democratic primary schedule has a bit of a lull for the next month. Puerto Rico holds a primary March 29. April 4 primaries include Hawaii with 24 delegates, Alaska with 15 and Wyoming’s caucuses with 14. Wisconsin has a primary April 7. And then on April 28, five states will make their choices, including New York with 274 delegates and Pennsylvania with 186 delegates. By winning the Florida and Illinois Republican primaries Tuesday night, President Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican party presidential nominee. He exceeded the 1,276 delegates needed to secure the nomination. “The Republican Party is more unified and energized than ever before and it’s because of President Trump’s leadership and clear record of accomplishment on behalf of all Americans,” Brad Parscale, Trump’s 2020 campaign manager said in a statement. Trump easily won every state that held a contest in the Republican primary. Former Vice President Joe Biden has beaten Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Illinois Democratic primary, according to Associated Press projections from voter surveys. The projected outcome, though not unexpected, will further cement Biden’s place as the clear frontrunner in the race for the Democratic nomination. The former vice president started his day Tuesday with a more than 153-delegate lead over Sanders. Voting in Illinois was set to wrap up at 8 p.m. EDT but was extended by an hour in dozens of Cook County precincts. Polling this month had put Biden ahead in Illinois with a large double-digit margin, and so the outcome in the Prairie State had long been forecast. On the other hand, coronavirus fears and early reports of low turnout in the state had raised questions about the predictive value of recent polling. There are 155 delegates at stake in Illinois, the second-largest delegate haul of the three states in play on Tuesday.  Voters in Florida and Arizona were also picking a Democratic candidate Tuesday in the first series of primary elections since the coronavirus has been thrust to the forefront of American consciousness. Biden posted a tweet Tuesday encouraging voters to cast a ballot curbside or by mail, if possible. Former Vice President Joe Biden has beaten Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in Florida’s Democratic primary, the biggest prize among Tuesday’s primaries with 219 pledged delegates, according to Associated Press projections from voter surveys.  The victory continues Biden’s sweep of southern states in the quest to challenge President Donald Trump in November. Illinois was also voting with 155 delegates and Arizona had 67 delegates at stake. Ohio, with 136 delegates, postponed its vote because of concerns about coronavirus. Biden’s win came as no surprise, after leading an average of statewide polling through Tuesday with 64% to 25% for Sanders, according to the tracking site FiveThirtyEight.com. One key distinction between the candidates in Florida, which is home to about 1.5 million Cuban Americans, was over U.S. policy toward the island nation.  Sanders, a Democratic socialist, has praised the literacy programs of Fidel Castro, the late dictator whose control over Cuba led to an estrangement from the U.S. for 50 years. But Biden criticized Sanders for supposing communists in Cuba and other authoritarian regimes. The Chicago Board of Elections is fighting to extend voting in five precincts by an hour Tuesday night amid low turnout due to the coronavirus outbreak. Reports of numerous polling places without necessary equipment or poll workers popped up during the day, as election officials blamed the state’s governor not postponing the primary in light of the outbreak. Jim Allen, spokesman for the Chicago Board of Election, told reporters the board asked the state last week to either delay the primary or move to a mail-in only race, multiple media outlets reported. The governor\'s office has disputed this ""as a lie."" According to the Chicago Board of Elections, those five precincts “will be open until 8 pm pending court order. All remaining precincts close at 7 pm.” Across the state of Illinois, and the country, efforts to contain the virus has escalated with thousands of schools temporarily closing, and restaurants shuttering to only provide take out or delivery services.  Trump on Monday issued guidelines that called for Americans to avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people. The 2020 Democratic primary broke the city’s record for early voting in a primary, with more than 145,000 people going to the polls early, according to the Chicago Tribune. But, election Day voter turnout in Chicago remained dismal through the night, with the voter turnout at just over 267,000 people of 6 pm.  The Chicago Board of Elections tweeted earlier: “This primary is happening in extraordinary times that we have never seen before. We admire the strength of all Chicagoans that are helping ensure our democracy continues today.” The Ohio Democratic Party sued election officials on Tuesday over their unusual decision to cancel in-person voting in the Buckeye State’s presidential primary because of the coronavirus, the latest legal fight to crop up over the move. Democrats sued Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, arguing he does not have the legal authority to reschedule a make-up election absent action from state lawmakers. Instead of setting a new election unilaterally, the suit seeks an extension of absentee balloting until late April. Democrats, who filed the suit in the Ohio Supreme Court, said the litigation was intended in part to preserve the option of a future election. Without it, they said, they are concerned that they might not get another shot at in-person voting.  ""This primary election must move forward,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. “Yesterday’s actions did not create unchecked authority with the governor or secretary of state to run a new election."" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced that the state would push back its election, originally scheduled for Tuesday, to June 2 because of coronavirus fears. But Democratic officials have urged states that have yet to hold their primaries to avoid changing dates. Ohio is one of several states, along with Louisiana, Kentucky and Maryland, that have postponed voting because of the virus. National party officials have requested that states “use a variety of other critical mechanisms” rather than moving primaries. Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez said Tuesday that it is “critical that states provide clarity and not confusion, which could lead to disenfranchising voters.” CHICAGO -- Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Chicago election officials feuded Tuesday over the state’s decision to push ahead with voting despite health concerns from the coronavirus pandemic. Election Day voter turnout in Chicago was dismal – around 126,000 by 1 p.m. – below even local mayoral elections in the city and one-third the turnout pace of the 2020 primary election. In the separate suburban Cook County, 119,000 had voted by 3 p.m., also vastly below past primary turnouts. Jim Allen, spokesman for the Chicago Board of Election, told reporters the board asked the state last week to either delay the primary or move to a mail-in only race, multiple media outlets reported. That drew a sharply worded tweet from Anne Caprara, Pritzker’s chief of staff: “This is a lie. And frankly, given what we are dealing with in this moment, I’m disgusted that Jim Allen would lie like this,” Caprara said. “We offered them the national guard, young volunteers and assistance with keeping polling places clean.” In another tweet, she added: “The Governor has been trying to balance continuity of government, not disenfranchising people who already voted, avoiding a legal crisis & keeping everyone safe. The Chicago Board of Elections have been worried about scoring cheap political points.” Although Election Day turnout will likely remain low in Chicago, the overall numbers could be lifted by strong early-voting figures. The 2020 Democratic primary broke the city’s record for early voting in a primary, with more than 145,000 people going to the polls early, according to the Chicago Tribune. It eclipsed the 140,000 who voted early in Chicago in the 2016 Democratic Primary. The city also broke a World War II-era record with 118,000 vote-by-mail ballot requests. Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden is the heavy favorite to win the most delegates in Illinois. The last two polls taken of likely Democratic voters in Illinois each found Biden ahead of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders by more than 20 percentage points. The Democratic National Committee is urging states who have yet to hold their primaries to avoid changing primary dates due to the coronavirus pandemic. DNC chairman Tom Perez said in a statement that states should instead  “use a variety of other critical mechanisms that will make voting easier and safer for voters and election officials alike,” instead “of moving primaries to later in the cycle when timing around the virus remains unpredictable.” He noted that states should use a vote-by-mail system or if they can still vote in-person under public health guidelines, then they should expand days and hours of early voting to reduce lines on Election Day.  ""As our country deals with the uncertainty of COVID-19, it is critical that states provide clarity and not confusion, which could lead to disenfranchising voters,” Perez said in the statement. The statement comes less than 24 hours after Ohio postponed their primary election last minute. The state’s primary was supposed to be held Tuesday and a new date has yet to be set. Several other states, including Louisiana, Kentucky and Maryland, have also postponed their primary dates. “What happened in Ohio last night has only bred more chaos and confusion, and the Democratic Party leadership in Ohio is working tirelessly to protect the right to vote,” Perez said in a statement. “Eligible voters deserve certainty, safety, and accessibility.”  “The right to vote is the foundation of our democracy, and we must do everything we can to protect and expand that right instead of bringing our democratic process to a halt,” Perez concluded. In a primary election suddenly consumed by fears about the coronavirus pandemic, seven in ten Florida voters said they trust former Vice President Joe Biden more than Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to handle a crisis, according to an NBC report on the poll. The results were widely consistent across the states voting Tuesday, the first to cast a ballot amid an outbreak of COVID-19 that has disrupted the routines of millions of Americans. More than six in 10 Illinois voters and 63% of Arizona voters said they would trust Biden more than Sanders to handle a crisis. Because of the virus and increasingly stringent requests for social distancing, the National Election Pool did not conduct in-person exit polls for Tuesday\'s primaries, NBC reported. Instead, the outlets conducted a telephone survey of voters before Tuesday\'s vote. After some Florida polling sites opened late Tuesday, Florida election officials defended their decision to press forward with its presidential primaries amid a global coronavirus pandemic. Secretary of State Laurel Lee said one precinct in Broward County opened late but was ""up and running,"" The Tallahassee Democrat reported, and there were ""isolated precincts in Palm Beach County that have had some challenges."" ""All other counties reported on-time opening of all voting locations around the state,"" she said. Lee said voters who did not want to go to polling sites over health concerns could pick up vote-by-mail ballots and turn them in by 7 p.m. EDT. A group of civils rights organizations, including the New Florida Majority, LatinoJustice and Dream Defenders, sued Lee and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in federal court Monday, seeking to extend vote-by-mail deadlines through March 27, to allow people concerned about going to precincts a chance to vote. WASHINGTON – Democratic primary voters in Florida, Illinois and Arizona found some confusion at polling places that moved or closed because of coronavirus, but voting advocates said Tuesday that turnout might still eclipse the 2016 primary. Alex Gulotta, Arizona state director of the advocacy group All Voting Is Local, said concerns about coronavirus prompted officials to close polling places, which confused voters about where to go. In Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, the number of polling places dropped from 240 to 151, but anyone who is registered could vote at any of them. But while in-person voting was running low at about 20% of expectations, more people voted already by mail than in 2016, Gulotta said. “We’ve had enormous turnout by mail,” he said. “Turnout has been very low today, but overall, voting is more than 2016.” Jay Young, executive director of Common Cause Illinois, said problems emerged early with election judges who didn’t show up and polling places closed. Poll workers complained about a lack of wipes or hand sanitizer, he said. “Here in Illinois, it’s been a hectic and trying day,” he said, with in-person turnout running about one-third the rate of previous primaries. Liza McClenaghan, board chair for Common Cause Florida, said a number of poll workers in Palm Beach County didn’t report to work Tuesday. Some had keys to polling places, which prevented them opening, and others had keys to equipment, which prevented using them, she said. The county invited voters to visit one of four election offices, or to mail in ballots. But McClenaghan said elderly voters have been asking where to vote as they discovered closed polling places and were suspicious of having mail-in ballots delivered by strangers. “We’ve had a dog’s breakfast about information for poll closings,” McClenaghan said. “We hope things improve shortly.” Karen Hobert Flynn, president of Common Cause, said the challenges in the primaries will give election officials an opportunity to find remedies such as allowing more mail-in voting by the November election. “Today we’re faced with a challenge unlike anything we’ve seen in our 50 years of advocacy, a global pandemic where all 50 states have now declared a state of emergency,” she said. WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. – Palm Beach County, Florida faced a shortage in poll workers Tuesday morning as Florida held its presidential primary amid the nation’s coronavirus pandemic. Some voters found closed doors when they arrived at their voting sites, The Palm Beach Post reported. Some locations opened late but others remained closed, prompting officials to allow voters pick up vote-by-mail ballots at any of the county’s election offices. Ahead of Election Day, around 800 poll workers notified Palm Beach elected officials they would not work because of concerns about the COVID-19 outbreak, leaving nearly 3,000 workers to cover Palm Beach County’s 454 voting sites. Penny Powell of West Palm Beach told The Post she went to her polling place, Pine Jog Environmental Center, to find it closed. She said a park worker sent her to the Supervisor of Elections\' main office, where she was able to vote. “They’re both close to each other so it wasn’t out of the way,” she said. “So I’m good with it.” She did not know why her location was not open. Former Vice President Joe Biden is heavily favored to defeat Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in Florida’s Democratic presidential primary. But turnout is a major wild card, particularly with the possibility it could disproportionately dissuade senior voters from the polls. Biden performs better among old voters while young voters overwhelmingly back Sanders. At one Palm Beach County location, the King’s Point clubhouse west of Delray Beach, only 32 people had voted as of noon. Poll workers there said they expected a low turnout because of the coronavirus. But at other locations, voters said they waited in line for nearly an hour. As coronavirus precautions, voters are told to space out six feet apart as they wait to vote. WASHINGTON – Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced Tuesday his state would postpone its primary, moving it from April 28 to June 2. The move comes as Arizona, Florida, and Illinois hold their Democratic presidential primary elections Tuesday. Ohio closed its polling places after Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, declared a ""health emergency."" ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at a unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said in a release late Monday.  The virus, which has been named COVID-19, already appears to have depressed turnout in morning voting in Chicago. The Chicago Board of Elections said there was ""extremely low turnout"" in morning voting. From 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. EDT, only 10,000 votes were cast, the Board said, as opposed to 30,000 votes that would be cast in a low turnout election.  Former Vice President Joe Biden currently leads the national delegate count with 898, whereas Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has 745 delegates. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, has two delegates.  Former Vice President Joe Biden is heavily favored to defeat Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders as Arizona Democrats head to the polls for the state’s primary election amid the global pandemic. Maricopa County election officials, in reaction to the coronavirus, closed 80 polling places and made the remaining 151 voting locations ""vote centers,” allowing voters to vote at any location, not just the one in their neighborhood.   Sanders visited Phoenix earlier this month to bolster his campaign. He is counting on the state\'s significant Latino population to provide a boost for him, but recent polling suggests he remains well behind here. --Ronald J. Hansen and Yvonne Wingett Sanchez, Arizona Republic."',

        ArticleContent: '"Joe Biden swept all three primaries on Tuesday night in Arizona, Florida and Illinois, CBS News projects. The contests took place amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis that led Ohio officials to postpone their primary, which had also been scheduled for Tuesday. In remarks after his early win in Florida, Biden, speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, said his campaign appeared to have had a ""very good night,"" but he also spoke about the coronavirus crisis. He told Americans that ""it\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy."" Bernie Sanders gave remarks via livestream earlier in the night. He focused mainly on the coronavirus crisis and highlighted unity. Tuesday\'s lopsided results will expand the divide in delegates between Biden and Sanders. It\'s unclear when the next primary contests will be held. Georgia, which had been set to vote on March 24, has postponed its primary, as did Louisiana, which was scheduled to go to the polls on April 4. As of 12 a.m. ET on Wednesday, Biden had increased his lead to 291 delegates. Biden now has 1,093 delegates to Sanders\' 802. To get the nomination, the Democratic candidate will need 1,991 delegates. According to CBS News primary polling in Arizona, the most important candidate quality for voters was being able to unite the country. Of those voters, 65% said they voted for Biden, while just 16% went for Sanders. The poll was mostly of voters who already voted by mail and includes those who said they were likely to show up at polls today. Like Florida and Illinois voters, 69% of Arizona voters saw Biden as the candidate with the best chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to 26% who believed the same of Sanders. Biden was also seen as the candidate trusted more to handle a major crisis. Biden led among white voters by 51% to 32%. Hispanic voters were more evenly divided: Biden 45% to Sanders 44%. CBS News projects the former vice president wins the Arizona primary, finalizing Biden\'s sweep of the three states that voted. Sixty-seven pledged delegates are up for grabs in Arizona. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose cheered the decision to postpone the state\'s primary election until June 2, saying it ""saved Ohio lives."" ""By preventing Ohioans from going to polling locations, we averted a situation which would have gone against the most recent scientific evidence available and could have dangerously advanced the spread of coronavirus across Ohio,"" the two said in a joining statement. ""It is abundantly clear that it would have been impossible to carry out a fair, accessible, and safe election today."" DeWine and LaRose stressed that Ohio voters should have a ""significant"" amount of time to cast mail-in absentee ballots and also vote in-person. Less than 12 hours before the polls were set to open in Ohio, DeWine announced that Dr. Amy Acton, director of the Ohio Department of Health, would be issuing an order to close polls ""to avoid the imminent threat with the high probability of widespread exposure to COVID-19."" As of 11 p.m. ET, Biden is leading in every county in Florida. Although Hillary Clinton won the primary in 2016, Sanders won nine counties in the northern part of the state in that contest. The Arizona secretary of state has revealed that personal information related to some protected voters was erroneously included in reports generated from the state\'s voter registration database. Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said in a statement that the error was not the result of a security breach or vulnerability. Hobbs said her office was notified from a county official that an early ballot report they compiled included ""protected voters,"" or those whose information is protected due to their jobs or if they were victims of certain crimes. Seventy-eight names were mistakenly included in the reports, the secretary of state\'s office said, and the office has asked county officials to contact those who were directly impacted. The early ballot reports are produced using data from the state\'s voter registration database, and the reports are provided by counties to political parties during elections. Hobb\'s office said the process for producing reports from the voter registration database has also been updated to prevent future errors. Biden celebrated his early wins in Illinois and Florida with a solemn address to supporters calling for the country to come together in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, while also thanking Bernie Sanders and his supporters for the ""remarkable passion"" they have brought to the Democratic race. Speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, with a backdrop of black cloth and flanked by two American flags, Biden remarked that his campaign ""has had a very good night"" and is moving closer to securing the Democratic presidential nomination. He also thanked election officials and poll workers in the three states with in-person voting for ensuring people could cast their ballots while also remaining safe. ""It\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy,"" he said. Biden said that his campaign is building a broad coalition that includes support from African-Americans, the Latino community, labor, firefighters, teachers, suburban women and others. ""We\'re doing it with a common vision,"" he said, adding that he and Sanders share that vision. The former vice president also thanked Sanders and his supporters for bringing ""remarkable passion and tenacity"" to issues like healthcare, income inequality and climate change, and delivered a message directly to young Sanders supporters. ""To young votes who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you, I know what\'s at stake. I know what we have to do,"" he said. ""Our goal as a campaign and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party and to unify the nation."" Biden also praised Americans for altering their lives as public health officials rush to limit the spread of the coronavirus, saying that Americans are ""ordinary people doing extraordinary things when the need arises and today we are moving quickly to adapt our routines to meet this challenge."" ""It\'s in moments like these we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans,"" Biden said. ""The coronavirus doesn\'t care if you\'re a Democrat or Republican. It will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender or your zip code. It will touch people in positions of power as well as the most vulnerable people in our society. We\'re all in this together."" A large number of likely voters in Illinois, 87%, said they were concerned about coronavirus, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to the primary. Biden received the support of likely voters concerned about the coronavirus by about 2-to-1. Similar percentages of likely voters are worried about the direction of the nation\'s economy in 2021, and Biden received their support by a similar margin. Sixty-four percent of likely voters in the Illinois primary picked Biden over Sanders as the person they would trust more to handle a major crisis. Likely primary voters in Illinois said beating President Trump was more important to them than having a candidate who agreed with them on the issues, and 69% said Biden would have the better chance to defeat the incumbent president in November. Polling shows Biden with a commanding lead among black likely voters – getting 70% of those polled – but he also received a majority vote of white likely voters as well, securing the support of both whites with and without college degrees. He received the support of over half of men and nearly two-thirds of women. The generational divide seen throughout this election cycle was also apparent in Illinois, with Sanders taking the vast majority of likely voters under 45, and Biden getting the strong support among older voters. But older likely voters significantly outnumbered their younger counterparts: more than six in ten likely voters were over the age of 45. And while Sanders maintains strong support of likely voters who say they are very liberal – getting nearly two-thirds support among this group – they made up just over a quarter of those polled. Biden garnered strong support among likely voters who said they were ""somewhat liberal"", and did particularly well among moderates. CBS News estimates Illinois leans toward Biden. At the moment, Chicago looks to be very close between Biden and Sanders, but many more votes are expected to be counted. The current delegate allocation in Illinois has Biden with 33 delegates and Sanders with 21. There are 155 total delegates at stake in Illinois. Following wins in the Republican primaries in Illinois and Florida, President Trump has secured the delegates needed to win the Republican presidential nomination, CBS News projects. President Trump has clinched the Republican nomination.https://t.co/E3KhCZjESV pic.twitter.com/YNT7WliBd0 — CBS News (@CBSNews) March 18, 2020 Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel offered congratulations to Mr. Trump for ""officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for president."" Congratulations to Donald J. Trump on officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for President! His home state of Florida just delivered him the delegates he needed. Our party is united, our grassroots movement is fired up, and we are ready for FOUR MORE YEARS! pic.twitter.com/B4X9IaQp7f — Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) March 18, 2020 Mr. Trump had several early challengers for the Republican nomination, though most dropped out of the race. Only former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld remains in the race. Most likely voters in Florida said electability was a priority for them going into the primary, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to March 17. Seventy-three percent of likely voters also think Biden would have a good chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to just 21% who picked Sanders. Voters over age 45 were more likely to say they support Biden. Those who want the next president to return to Obama policies instead of more liberal policies said they would vote for Biden. Nearly half of Florida likely voters said Sanders\' issue positions were too liberal, but most said Biden\'s issue positions were about right. Florida likely voters said they trusted Biden over Sanders by a wide margin — 59% to 37% — to handle Social Security. anders addressed supporters in a livestreamed speech after polls closed in most of Florida and called for the country to come together as local, state and federal officials respond to the coronavirus. ""I think the main point to be made tonight is that in this moment of crisis, it is imperative that we stand together, understand that right now throughout this country, there are so many of our people wondering what\'s going to happen to me tomorrow?"" Sanders said. He added that ""this is a moment that we have got to be working together."" Sanders laid out a series of proposals he said he plans to present to Democratic leadership and said an adequate response will require an ""unprecedented"" amount of money."" Sanders estimated the price tag will top $2 trillion. The plans put forth by Sanders to bolster the response to the coronavirus include allowing Medicare to cover all medical bills during the public health crisis; increasing test kits for the coronavirus and the speed at which tests are processed; activating the National Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other military resources to help expand healthcare capacity; and using emergency authority to scale up production in the U.S. of critical supplies and protective equipment. Sanders also suggested a number of measures to mitigate the economic impacts for American workers and their families, including providing a $2,000 monthly cash payment to every household for the duration of the crisis, expanding Meals on Wheels and food stamps and placing a moratorium on evictions, foreclosures and utility shutoffs. ""We must make certain that the government is getting this money into the hands of working families and the most vulnerable as quickly as possible,"" he said. Sanders said the economic crisis should not be ""another money-making opportunity"" for large corporations and Wall Street. ""We\'ve got some major crisis, but I have the strong belief that if we work together, if we do not turn to fear and panic, but if we understand that the way we solve this is by going forward as one people, remembering those who are hurting tonight and will be hurting in the future,"" he said. ""This is the richest country in the history world. This is a country with unbelievable energy, with unbelievable talent, with incredible resources. We can do it. We can address this crisis, we can minimize the pain and let us do just that."" CBS News projects Biden will win Florida, the biggest prize in Tuesday\'s primaries with 219 pledged delegates. Florida has a large Hispanic population, and Biden has previously struggled to gain support from Hispanic voters in states which have already held primaries, like Nevada. The delegate allocation at poll closing in Florida was 100 delegates for Biden, and 27 for Sanders, according to CBS News\' analysis. All polls are now closed in Florida and in Illinois, after an election day marked by fears about the spread of the coronavirus. Polls close in Arizona at 10 p.m. ET. The Ohio primary has been pushed back until June 2. Sanders will livestream remarks about the coronavirus crisis at 7:15 p.m., shortly after polls close in Florida. The speech will address how the ""response to the outbreak should put working families and the most vulnerable first,"" according to a press release from the campaign. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democrats said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Biden and Sanders have made remarks outlining their plans to respond to the crisis. The Florida Democratic Party said the number of Democrats who have voted early in person and by mail has exceeded turnout in the primaries in 2016. According to the state party, 141,560 more Democrats voted by mail this year than they did in the last presidential primary. Additionally, 74,031 more Democrats voted early in person this year than in 2016. The Florida Democratic Party also said it enrolled nearly 500,000 new Democrats into vote-by-mail in 2018. The party said that the coronavirus pandemic, which has impacted voting in states holding their contests today, demonstrates the need for the government to revamp voting methods. As the country deals with a health care crisis, the issue of health care remains on voters\' minds. In Arizona, Florida, and Illinois, voters picked health care as the issue that would be most important in determining their vote, according to CBS News primary polls. The second most important issue among voters in each of the three states was income inequality, followed by climate change and race relations. Likely Democratic voters in Illinois said they are also worried about the economy, primary polls show. More than eight in 10 are least somewhat concerned about the national economy over the next year. In the three states where voters will head to the polls Tuesday, most said they prefer the Democratic nominee be someone who can beat Trump — at least six in 10 in each state— over someone they agree with on major issues, according to CBS News primary polls. As has been the case throughout this campaign, there are high levels of dissatisfaction toward the Trump administration among the Democratic primary electorate. Large majorities of likely voters in Florida and Illinois and those who voted by mail in Arizona said they feel angry about the Trump administration. Among likely Democratic voters in Illinois, more Sanders supporters said they would be unhappy about Biden being the nominee than Biden supporters would be if Sanders became the nominee, according to primary polls. Fifty-four percent of Sanders supporters would be dissatisfied or upset if Biden won the nomination, compared to 37% of Biden backers who would feel that way if Sanders became the nominee. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democratic voters said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Among those polled in Florida, 71% said they trusted Biden more, compared to 23% who said Sanders is the candidate they trust to handle a major crisis. In Illinois, 64% of Democratic voters selected Biden while 31% said Sanders is more trusted, and in Arizona, 63% said they trust Biden more to handle a major crisis compared to 31%, who pointed to Sanders. The Democratic National Committee is calling on states that haven\'t yet held their primaries to vote by mail, as coronavirus threatens future primaries. ""The simplest tool is vote by mail, which is already in use in a number of states and should be made available to all registered voters. States using vote by mail should proactively mail ballots to registered voters, where feasible, and should count all ballots as long as they are postmarked by the date of the primary,"" DNC chair Tom Perez said in a statement on Wednesday. Where in-person voting can take place in accordance with health guidelines, states should expand the days and hours of early voting to cut down on lines, Perez added. According to CBS News primary polls, nearly all likely voters in Illinois expressed at least some concern about the effects of the coronavirus, including more than half who said they are very concerned about it. Most likely voters of all ages in Illinois said they are concerned, but older voters are particularly so: 62% of voters ages 45 and over say they are very concerned, compared to 38% of younger voters. Women (59%) were also more likely than men (46%) to be very concerned. Some voters, meanwhile, said the coronavirus could change their decision to vote. In Florida, among those who said they would definitely vote and planned to do so in person on Election Day, 15% said it was very or somewhat likely that they could change their decision to vote. In Illinois, that figure was 9%, according to primary polls. The Biden campaign is optimistic it will walk away from Tuesday\'s primaries with a wider delegate lead than it had going into the contests despite the challenges to voter turnout raised because of the coronavirus. ""It would take a drastic, historically-incomparable swing for Senator Sanders to win more delegates than Biden today or to close the delegate differential,"" the campaign said in a memo released Tuesday. Heading into the four primaries held on Tuesday, Biden led Sanders by more than 100 delegates. The former vice president\'s campaign also noted that while fewer people may head to the polls on Election Day because of the coronavirus, it expects overall turnout to match that of past elections. ""While voter turnout on Election Day itself may be lower due to COVID-19 concerns, we believe that, with early vote and vote by mail, overall turnout will be roughly on pace for 2016 in Arizona and Florida and roughly on pace for 2018 in Illinois, and that voter turnout in all three states will reflect the population at large,"" the campaign said in the memo. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, on Tuesday defended the decision to keep the polls open despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. ""There are people out there today who want to say, \'Oh, it\'s a crisis, bend the rules and overstep your authority,\'"" Pritzker said. ""Let me tell you this, It is exactly in times like these, when the constitutional boundaries of our democracy should be respected above all else. And if people want to criticize me for that, well, go ahead. I\'ll wear it like a badge of honor."" Earlier Tuesday, Chicago Board of Elections spokesman Jim Allen said he urged Pritzker to prohibit voting in person and go fully vote-by-mail. Allen later apologized for the remarks. The Chicago Board of Elections said they said they\'ve had to move in total 200 precincts, with some locations in the city dropping out as soon as this morning (these cases were immediately moved to a new location). In Chicago, 126,499 votes have been cast through 2 p.m. ET, with a surge after the first two hours. Biden tweeted a reminder about polls being open in Arizona, Florida and Illinois. ""I encourage folks to vote by mail or curbside vote if you can,"" Biden wrote. ""If you vote in person, please wash your hands, don\'t touch your face, and stay 6\' from others in line."" Maryland Governor Larry Hogan announced at a press conference on Tuesday morning that the state will move its primary from April 28 until June 2. The state Board of Elections issued a statement shortly after that ""fully supports"" Hogan\'s decision. The decision follows similar action in Georgia, Kentucky and Louisiana. In a last-minute move on Monday, Ohio postponed its primary. The Ohio State Supreme Court denied a challenge to Ohio\'s primary delay filed by Wood County judicial candidate Corey Speweik, who was fighting the state of Ohio\'s decision to shut down Tuesday\'s primary and postpone voting until June over concern about the spread of the coronavirus. The process leading up to the delay was chaotic. With less than 12 hours to go before polls were scheduled to open in Ohio for the state\'s presidential primary election, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, announced polls would remain closed Tuesday amid concerns over the coronavirus. The decision came just hours after a Franklin County judge denied a request backed by the governor and secretary of state to delay the election. The Ohio Democratic Party said in a statement Tuesday that although voting did not seem feasible, it hoped the primary would be rescheduled for earlier than June 2. ""Given the chaos, confusion and mixed messages of the past 24 hours, it\'s clearly impossible for in-person voting to move forward today in Ohio,"" the party said in a statement. ""The Ohio Democratic Party strongly supports concluding the primary election earlier than June 2. Extending for that long is highly problematic for any number for reasons, and it is not at all clear that in-person voting will be possible on that date anyway,"" the statement continued. At a news conference Monday, in response to a question about the possible impact of the coronavirus outbreak, President Trump said delaying elections would be ""not a very good thing."" ""I\'d leave that up to the states,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Postponing elections is not a very good thing … I think postponing is unnecessary."" A poll by Monmouth University released on Monday showed Biden with a double-digit advantage over Sanders in Arizona. Among voters likely to participate in the primary, Biden was supported by 51% to Sanders\' 31%. Sanders leads among Latino voters by seven points, and among voters under 50 years old by wide margins. But this is more than offset by Biden\'s strong advantage among larger voter blocs, including white voters and those aged 50 and over. In head-to-head matchups with the president, Biden had a small edge Mr. Trump, but the president was virtually tied with Sanders. Although Arizona has long been a solid red state, it could be a battleground this November. Mr. Trump only won the state by 4 points against Hillary Clinton in 2016. In the Senate race, Democrat Mark Kelly had a 6-point edge in the poll over incumbent Martha McSally. "',
        AnswerContent: '"Check back for updates as polls close in three states amid the coronavirus pandemic. Former Vice President Joe Biden swept all three states voting Tuesday in a series of primaries that were heavily influenced by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. His last win of the night came in Arizona, where the Associated Press projected a victory through voter surveys. Biden secured early projected wins in Florida and Illinois, where he was long heavily favored to win, and he captured the state of Arizona shortly after polls there closed at 10 p.m. EDT. In all, more than 440 delegates were up for grabs in the latest round of voting, and Biden’s projected victories handed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders a formidable challenge to catch up. It was the first series of primaries to take place amid the national state of emergency President Donald Trump declared over the coronavirus pandemic, a circumstance that had the potential to upend the candidates’ messages as well as the technical process of running a primary election. The Democratic primary schedule has a bit of a lull for the next month. Puerto Rico holds a primary March 29. April 4 primaries include Hawaii with 24 delegates, Alaska with 15 and Wyoming’s caucuses with 14. Wisconsin has a primary April 7. And then on April 28, five states will make their choices, including New York with 274 delegates and Pennsylvania with 186 delegates. Ohioans were set to cast their ballots on Tuesday but state officials there announced they would postpone the election until sometime after the outbreak had passed. “This pandemic has impacted every aspect of our lives, and every aspect of this campaign,” Biden said in a video streamed from his home in Delaware, where he eschewed the traditional rally to deliver his election night remarks. “It’s at moments like these that we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans.” Both candidates avoided attacks on each other, or even discussing the latest contours of the race.    “In this moment of crisis it is imperative that we stand together,” Sanders said in his own video message. “This is a moment that we’ve got to be working together.” Heading into the election, Biden had a better than 153-delegate lead over Sanders.    Trump, who never faced a significant challenge, also swept the primaries Tuesday and exceeded the 1,276 delegates needed to become the GOP’s presumptive nominee. As Arizona’s polls closed Tuesday with uncertain results, former Vice President Joe Biden looked to add to his Democratic primary wins in Florida and Illinois against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, according to Associated Press projections from voter surveys. Biden’s victories came on the same night President Donald Trump locked up the Republican nomination for his re-election. Biden said from his home in Wilmington, Del., that the victories demonstrated a broad coalition to beat Trump, including blacks, Hispanics, suburban women and veterans. He commended Sanders’ supporters and said they share a vision for affordable health care, a need to reduce income inequality and to fight climate change. “Sen. Sanders and I may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision,” Biden said. “Sen. Sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all of these issues.” Florida offered the biggest prize for Biden, with 219 pledged delegates. At stake in Illinois were 155 delegates and in Arizona were 67 delegates. Ohio, with 136 delegates, postponed its vote because of concerns about coronavirus. The virus declared a worldwide pandemic wreaked havoc with the primaries in all three states, according to voting advocates. Poll workers failed to show up to work. Election officials closed polling places for lack of staff and to move them away from residential facilities for the elderly. And workers lacked wipes and hand sanitizer to reduce the spread of disease. “This pandemic has impacted every aspect of our life, and every aspect of this campaign,” Biden said. “Tackling this pandemic is a national emergency akin to fighting a war.” But the victories built on Biden’s lead toward meeting the 1,991 delegates needed to clinch the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. Biden had at least 1,121 delegates, compared to 839 for Sanders, according to an AP tabulation. Political experts say the remaining states offer little chance for Sanders to make large enough strides to overtake Biden. For example, the Florida win continued Biden’s successful march across the south, after South Carolina revived his campaign Feb. 29. He swept southern states on March 3 Super Tuesday. Still ahead are Georgia May 19 and Louisiana on June 20. The Democratic primary schedule has a bit of a lull for the next month. Puerto Rico holds a primary March 29. April 4 primaries include Hawaii with 24 delegates, Alaska with 15 and Wyoming’s caucuses with 14. Wisconsin has a primary April 7. And then on April 28, five states will make their choices, including New York with 274 delegates and Pennsylvania with 186 delegates. By winning the Florida and Illinois Republican primaries Tuesday night, President Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican party presidential nominee. He exceeded the 1,276 delegates needed to secure the nomination. “The Republican Party is more unified and energized than ever before and it’s because of President Trump’s leadership and clear record of accomplishment on behalf of all Americans,” Brad Parscale, Trump’s 2020 campaign manager said in a statement. Trump easily won every state that held a contest in the Republican primary. Former Vice President Joe Biden has beaten Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Illinois Democratic primary, according to Associated Press projections from voter surveys. The projected outcome, though not unexpected, will further cement Biden’s place as the clear frontrunner in the race for the Democratic nomination. The former vice president started his day Tuesday with a more than 153-delegate lead over Sanders. Voting in Illinois was set to wrap up at 8 p.m. EDT but was extended by an hour in dozens of Cook County precincts. Polling this month had put Biden ahead in Illinois with a large double-digit margin, and so the outcome in the Prairie State had long been forecast. On the other hand, coronavirus fears and early reports of low turnout in the state had raised questions about the predictive value of recent polling. There are 155 delegates at stake in Illinois, the second-largest delegate haul of the three states in play on Tuesday.  Voters in Florida and Arizona were also picking a Democratic candidate Tuesday in the first series of primary elections since the coronavirus has been thrust to the forefront of American consciousness. Biden posted a tweet Tuesday encouraging voters to cast a ballot curbside or by mail, if possible. Former Vice President Joe Biden has beaten Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in Florida’s Democratic primary, the biggest prize among Tuesday’s primaries with 219 pledged delegates, according to Associated Press projections from voter surveys.  The victory continues Biden’s sweep of southern states in the quest to challenge President Donald Trump in November. Illinois was also voting with 155 delegates and Arizona had 67 delegates at stake. Ohio, with 136 delegates, postponed its vote because of concerns about coronavirus. Biden’s win came as no surprise, after leading an average of statewide polling through Tuesday with 64% to 25% for Sanders, according to the tracking site FiveThirtyEight.com. One key distinction between the candidates in Florida, which is home to about 1.5 million Cuban Americans, was over U.S. policy toward the island nation.  Sanders, a Democratic socialist, has praised the literacy programs of Fidel Castro, the late dictator whose control over Cuba led to an estrangement from the U.S. for 50 years. But Biden criticized Sanders for supposing communists in Cuba and other authoritarian regimes. The Chicago Board of Elections is fighting to extend voting in five precincts by an hour Tuesday night amid low turnout due to the coronavirus outbreak. Reports of numerous polling places without necessary equipment or poll workers popped up during the day, as election officials blamed the state’s governor not postponing the primary in light of the outbreak. Jim Allen, spokesman for the Chicago Board of Election, told reporters the board asked the state last week to either delay the primary or move to a mail-in only race, multiple media outlets reported. The governor\'s office has disputed this ""as a lie."" According to the Chicago Board of Elections, those five precincts “will be open until 8 pm pending court order. All remaining precincts close at 7 pm.” Across the state of Illinois, and the country, efforts to contain the virus has escalated with thousands of schools temporarily closing, and restaurants shuttering to only provide take out or delivery services.  Trump on Monday issued guidelines that called for Americans to avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people. The 2020 Democratic primary broke the city’s record for early voting in a primary, with more than 145,000 people going to the polls early, according to the Chicago Tribune. But, election Day voter turnout in Chicago remained dismal through the night, with the voter turnout at just over 267,000 people of 6 pm.  The Chicago Board of Elections tweeted earlier: “This primary is happening in extraordinary times that we have never seen before. We admire the strength of all Chicagoans that are helping ensure our democracy continues today.” The Ohio Democratic Party sued election officials on Tuesday over their unusual decision to cancel in-person voting in the Buckeye State’s presidential primary because of the coronavirus, the latest legal fight to crop up over the move. Democrats sued Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, arguing he does not have the legal authority to reschedule a make-up election absent action from state lawmakers. Instead of setting a new election unilaterally, the suit seeks an extension of absentee balloting until late April. Democrats, who filed the suit in the Ohio Supreme Court, said the litigation was intended in part to preserve the option of a future election. Without it, they said, they are concerned that they might not get another shot at in-person voting.  ""This primary election must move forward,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. “Yesterday’s actions did not create unchecked authority with the governor or secretary of state to run a new election."" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced that the state would push back its election, originally scheduled for Tuesday, to June 2 because of coronavirus fears. But Democratic officials have urged states that have yet to hold their primaries to avoid changing dates. Ohio is one of several states, along with Louisiana, Kentucky and Maryland, that have postponed voting because of the virus. National party officials have requested that states “use a variety of other critical mechanisms” rather than moving primaries. Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez said Tuesday that it is “critical that states provide clarity and not confusion, which could lead to disenfranchising voters.” CHICAGO -- Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Chicago election officials feuded Tuesday over the state’s decision to push ahead with voting despite health concerns from the coronavirus pandemic. Election Day voter turnout in Chicago was dismal – around 126,000 by 1 p.m. – below even local mayoral elections in the city and one-third the turnout pace of the 2020 primary election. In the separate suburban Cook County, 119,000 had voted by 3 p.m., also vastly below past primary turnouts. Jim Allen, spokesman for the Chicago Board of Election, told reporters the board asked the state last week to either delay the primary or move to a mail-in only race, multiple media outlets reported. That drew a sharply worded tweet from Anne Caprara, Pritzker’s chief of staff: “This is a lie. And frankly, given what we are dealing with in this moment, I’m disgusted that Jim Allen would lie like this,” Caprara said. “We offered them the national guard, young volunteers and assistance with keeping polling places clean.” In another tweet, she added: “The Governor has been trying to balance continuity of government, not disenfranchising people who already voted, avoiding a legal crisis & keeping everyone safe. The Chicago Board of Elections have been worried about scoring cheap political points.” Although Election Day turnout will likely remain low in Chicago, the overall numbers could be lifted by strong early-voting figures. The 2020 Democratic primary broke the city’s record for early voting in a primary, with more than 145,000 people going to the polls early, according to the Chicago Tribune. It eclipsed the 140,000 who voted early in Chicago in the 2016 Democratic Primary. The city also broke a World War II-era record with 118,000 vote-by-mail ballot requests. Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden is the heavy favorite to win the most delegates in Illinois. The last two polls taken of likely Democratic voters in Illinois each found Biden ahead of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders by more than 20 percentage points. The Democratic National Committee is urging states who have yet to hold their primaries to avoid changing primary dates due to the coronavirus pandemic. DNC chairman Tom Perez said in a statement that states should instead  “use a variety of other critical mechanisms that will make voting easier and safer for voters and election officials alike,” instead “of moving primaries to later in the cycle when timing around the virus remains unpredictable.” He noted that states should use a vote-by-mail system or if they can still vote in-person under public health guidelines, then they should expand days and hours of early voting to reduce lines on Election Day.  ""As our country deals with the uncertainty of COVID-19, it is critical that states provide clarity and not confusion, which could lead to disenfranchising voters,” Perez said in the statement. The statement comes less than 24 hours after Ohio postponed their primary election last minute. The state’s primary was supposed to be held Tuesday and a new date has yet to be set. Several other states, including Louisiana, Kentucky and Maryland, have also postponed their primary dates. “What happened in Ohio last night has only bred more chaos and confusion, and the Democratic Party leadership in Ohio is working tirelessly to protect the right to vote,” Perez said in a statement. “Eligible voters deserve certainty, safety, and accessibility.”  “The right to vote is the foundation of our democracy, and we must do everything we can to protect and expand that right instead of bringing our democratic process to a halt,” Perez concluded. In a primary election suddenly consumed by fears about the coronavirus pandemic, seven in ten Florida voters said they trust former Vice President Joe Biden more than Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to handle a crisis, according to an NBC report on the poll. The results were widely consistent across the states voting Tuesday, the first to cast a ballot amid an outbreak of COVID-19 that has disrupted the routines of millions of Americans. More than six in 10 Illinois voters and 63% of Arizona voters said they would trust Biden more than Sanders to handle a crisis. Because of the virus and increasingly stringent requests for social distancing, the National Election Pool did not conduct in-person exit polls for Tuesday\'s primaries, NBC reported. Instead, the outlets conducted a telephone survey of voters before Tuesday\'s vote. After some Florida polling sites opened late Tuesday, Florida election officials defended their decision to press forward with its presidential primaries amid a global coronavirus pandemic. Secretary of State Laurel Lee said one precinct in Broward County opened late but was ""up and running,"" The Tallahassee Democrat reported, and there were ""isolated precincts in Palm Beach County that have had some challenges."" ""All other counties reported on-time opening of all voting locations around the state,"" she said. Lee said voters who did not want to go to polling sites over health concerns could pick up vote-by-mail ballots and turn them in by 7 p.m. EDT. A group of civils rights organizations, including the New Florida Majority, LatinoJustice and Dream Defenders, sued Lee and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in federal court Monday, seeking to extend vote-by-mail deadlines through March 27, to allow people concerned about going to precincts a chance to vote. WASHINGTON – Democratic primary voters in Florida, Illinois and Arizona found some confusion at polling places that moved or closed because of coronavirus, but voting advocates said Tuesday that turnout might still eclipse the 2016 primary. Alex Gulotta, Arizona state director of the advocacy group All Voting Is Local, said concerns about coronavirus prompted officials to close polling places, which confused voters about where to go. In Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, the number of polling places dropped from 240 to 151, but anyone who is registered could vote at any of them. But while in-person voting was running low at about 20% of expectations, more people voted already by mail than in 2016, Gulotta said. “We’ve had enormous turnout by mail,” he said. “Turnout has been very low today, but overall, voting is more than 2016.” Jay Young, executive director of Common Cause Illinois, said problems emerged early with election judges who didn’t show up and polling places closed. Poll workers complained about a lack of wipes or hand sanitizer, he said. “Here in Illinois, it’s been a hectic and trying day,” he said, with in-person turnout running about one-third the rate of previous primaries. Liza McClenaghan, board chair for Common Cause Florida, said a number of poll workers in Palm Beach County didn’t report to work Tuesday. Some had keys to polling places, which prevented them opening, and others had keys to equipment, which prevented using them, she said. The county invited voters to visit one of four election offices, or to mail in ballots. But McClenaghan said elderly voters have been asking where to vote as they discovered closed polling places and were suspicious of having mail-in ballots delivered by strangers. “We’ve had a dog’s breakfast about information for poll closings,” McClenaghan said. “We hope things improve shortly.” Karen Hobert Flynn, president of Common Cause, said the challenges in the primaries will give election officials an opportunity to find remedies such as allowing more mail-in voting by the November election. “Today we’re faced with a challenge unlike anything we’ve seen in our 50 years of advocacy, a global pandemic where all 50 states have now declared a state of emergency,” she said. WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. – Palm Beach County, Florida faced a shortage in poll workers Tuesday morning as Florida held its presidential primary amid the nation’s coronavirus pandemic. Some voters found closed doors when they arrived at their voting sites, The Palm Beach Post reported. Some locations opened late but others remained closed, prompting officials to allow voters pick up vote-by-mail ballots at any of the county’s election offices. Ahead of Election Day, around 800 poll workers notified Palm Beach elected officials they would not work because of concerns about the COVID-19 outbreak, leaving nearly 3,000 workers to cover Palm Beach County’s 454 voting sites. Penny Powell of West Palm Beach told The Post she went to her polling place, Pine Jog Environmental Center, to find it closed. She said a park worker sent her to the Supervisor of Elections\' main office, where she was able to vote. “They’re both close to each other so it wasn’t out of the way,” she said. “So I’m good with it.” She did not know why her location was not open. Former Vice President Joe Biden is heavily favored to defeat Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in Florida’s Democratic presidential primary. But turnout is a major wild card, particularly with the possibility it could disproportionately dissuade senior voters from the polls. Biden performs better among old voters while young voters overwhelmingly back Sanders. At one Palm Beach County location, the King’s Point clubhouse west of Delray Beach, only 32 people had voted as of noon. Poll workers there said they expected a low turnout because of the coronavirus. But at other locations, voters said they waited in line for nearly an hour. As coronavirus precautions, voters are told to space out six feet apart as they wait to vote. WASHINGTON – Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced Tuesday his state would postpone its primary, moving it from April 28 to June 2. The move comes as Arizona, Florida, and Illinois hold their Democratic presidential primary elections Tuesday. Ohio closed its polling places after Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, declared a ""health emergency."" ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at a unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said in a release late Monday.  The virus, which has been named COVID-19, already appears to have depressed turnout in morning voting in Chicago. The Chicago Board of Elections said there was ""extremely low turnout"" in morning voting. From 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. EDT, only 10,000 votes were cast, the Board said, as opposed to 30,000 votes that would be cast in a low turnout election.  Former Vice President Joe Biden currently leads the national delegate count with 898, whereas Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has 745 delegates. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, has two delegates.  Former Vice President Joe Biden is heavily favored to defeat Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders as Arizona Democrats head to the polls for the state’s primary election amid the global pandemic. Maricopa County election officials, in reaction to the coronavirus, closed 80 polling places and made the remaining 151 voting locations ""vote centers,” allowing voters to vote at any location, not just the one in their neighborhood.   Sanders visited Phoenix earlier this month to bolster his campaign. He is counting on the state\'s significant Latino population to provide a boost for him, but recent polling suggests he remains well behind here. --Ronald J. Hansen and Yvonne Wingett Sanchez, Arizona Republic."',

        ArticleContent: '"Joe Biden swept all three primaries on Tuesday night in Arizona, Florida and Illinois, CBS News projects. The contests took place amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis that led Ohio officials to postpone their primary, which had also been scheduled for Tuesday. In remarks after his early win in Florida, Biden, speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, said his campaign appeared to have had a ""very good night,"" but he also spoke about the coronavirus crisis. He told Americans that ""it\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy."" Bernie Sanders gave remarks via livestream earlier in the night. He focused mainly on the coronavirus crisis and highlighted unity. Tuesday\'s lopsided results will expand the divide in delegates between Biden and Sanders. It\'s unclear when the next primary contests will be held. Georgia, which had been set to vote on March 24, has postponed its primary, as did Louisiana, which was scheduled to go to the polls on April 4. As of 12 a.m. ET on Wednesday, Biden had increased his lead to 291 delegates. Biden now has 1,093 delegates to Sanders\' 802. To get the nomination, the Democratic candidate will need 1,991 delegates. According to CBS News primary polling in Arizona, the most important candidate quality for voters was being able to unite the country. Of those voters, 65% said they voted for Biden, while just 16% went for Sanders. The poll was mostly of voters who already voted by mail and includes those who said they were likely to show up at polls today. Like Florida and Illinois voters, 69% of Arizona voters saw Biden as the candidate with the best chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to 26% who believed the same of Sanders. Biden was also seen as the candidate trusted more to handle a major crisis. Biden led among white voters by 51% to 32%. Hispanic voters were more evenly divided: Biden 45% to Sanders 44%. CBS News projects the former vice president wins the Arizona primary, finalizing Biden\'s sweep of the three states that voted. Sixty-seven pledged delegates are up for grabs in Arizona. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose cheered the decision to postpone the state\'s primary election until June 2, saying it ""saved Ohio lives."" ""By preventing Ohioans from going to polling locations, we averted a situation which would have gone against the most recent scientific evidence available and could have dangerously advanced the spread of coronavirus across Ohio,"" the two said in a joining statement. ""It is abundantly clear that it would have been impossible to carry out a fair, accessible, and safe election today."" DeWine and LaRose stressed that Ohio voters should have a ""significant"" amount of time to cast mail-in absentee ballots and also vote in-person. Less than 12 hours before the polls were set to open in Ohio, DeWine announced that Dr. Amy Acton, director of the Ohio Department of Health, would be issuing an order to close polls ""to avoid the imminent threat with the high probability of widespread exposure to COVID-19."" As of 11 p.m. ET, Biden is leading in every county in Florida. Although Hillary Clinton won the primary in 2016, Sanders won nine counties in the northern part of the state in that contest. The Arizona secretary of state has revealed that personal information related to some protected voters was erroneously included in reports generated from the state\'s voter registration database. Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said in a statement that the error was not the result of a security breach or vulnerability. Hobbs said her office was notified from a county official that an early ballot report they compiled included ""protected voters,"" or those whose information is protected due to their jobs or if they were victims of certain crimes. Seventy-eight names were mistakenly included in the reports, the secretary of state\'s office said, and the office has asked county officials to contact those who were directly impacted. The early ballot reports are produced using data from the state\'s voter registration database, and the reports are provided by counties to political parties during elections. Hobb\'s office said the process for producing reports from the voter registration database has also been updated to prevent future errors. Biden celebrated his early wins in Illinois and Florida with a solemn address to supporters calling for the country to come together in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, while also thanking Bernie Sanders and his supporters for the ""remarkable passion"" they have brought to the Democratic race. Speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, with a backdrop of black cloth and flanked by two American flags, Biden remarked that his campaign ""has had a very good night"" and is moving closer to securing the Democratic presidential nomination. He also thanked election officials and poll workers in the three states with in-person voting for ensuring people could cast their ballots while also remaining safe. ""It\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy,"" he said. Biden said that his campaign is building a broad coalition that includes support from African-Americans, the Latino community, labor, firefighters, teachers, suburban women and others. ""We\'re doing it with a common vision,"" he said, adding that he and Sanders share that vision. The former vice president also thanked Sanders and his supporters for bringing ""remarkable passion and tenacity"" to issues like healthcare, income inequality and climate change, and delivered a message directly to young Sanders supporters. ""To young votes who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you, I know what\'s at stake. I know what we have to do,"" he said. ""Our goal as a campaign and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party and to unify the nation."" Biden also praised Americans for altering their lives as public health officials rush to limit the spread of the coronavirus, saying that Americans are ""ordinary people doing extraordinary things when the need arises and today we are moving quickly to adapt our routines to meet this challenge."" ""It\'s in moments like these we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans,"" Biden said. ""The coronavirus doesn\'t care if you\'re a Democrat or Republican. It will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender or your zip code. It will touch people in positions of power as well as the most vulnerable people in our society. We\'re all in this together."" A large number of likely voters in Illinois, 87%, said they were concerned about coronavirus, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to the primary. Biden received the support of likely voters concerned about the coronavirus by about 2-to-1. Similar percentages of likely voters are worried about the direction of the nation\'s economy in 2021, and Biden received their support by a similar margin. Sixty-four percent of likely voters in the Illinois primary picked Biden over Sanders as the person they would trust more to handle a major crisis. Likely primary voters in Illinois said beating President Trump was more important to them than having a candidate who agreed with them on the issues, and 69% said Biden would have the better chance to defeat the incumbent president in November. Polling shows Biden with a commanding lead among black likely voters – getting 70% of those polled – but he also received a majority vote of white likely voters as well, securing the support of both whites with and without college degrees. He received the support of over half of men and nearly two-thirds of women. The generational divide seen throughout this election cycle was also apparent in Illinois, with Sanders taking the vast majority of likely voters under 45, and Biden getting the strong support among older voters. But older likely voters significantly outnumbered their younger counterparts: more than six in ten likely voters were over the age of 45. And while Sanders maintains strong support of likely voters who say they are very liberal – getting nearly two-thirds support among this group – they made up just over a quarter of those polled. Biden garnered strong support among likely voters who said they were ""somewhat liberal"", and did particularly well among moderates. CBS News estimates Illinois leans toward Biden. At the moment, Chicago looks to be very close between Biden and Sanders, but many more votes are expected to be counted. The current delegate allocation in Illinois has Biden with 33 delegates and Sanders with 21. There are 155 total delegates at stake in Illinois. Following wins in the Republican primaries in Illinois and Florida, President Trump has secured the delegates needed to win the Republican presidential nomination, CBS News projects. President Trump has clinched the Republican nomination.https://t.co/E3KhCZjESV pic.twitter.com/YNT7WliBd0 — CBS News (@CBSNews) March 18, 2020 Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel offered congratulations to Mr. Trump for ""officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for president."" Congratulations to Donald J. Trump on officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for President! His home state of Florida just delivered him the delegates he needed. Our party is united, our grassroots movement is fired up, and we are ready for FOUR MORE YEARS! pic.twitter.com/B4X9IaQp7f — Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) March 18, 2020 Mr. Trump had several early challengers for the Republican nomination, though most dropped out of the race. Only former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld remains in the race. Most likely voters in Florida said electability was a priority for them going into the primary, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to March 17. Seventy-three percent of likely voters also think Biden would have a good chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to just 21% who picked Sanders. Voters over age 45 were more likely to say they support Biden. Those who want the next president to return to Obama policies instead of more liberal policies said they would vote for Biden. Nearly half of Florida likely voters said Sanders\' issue positions were too liberal, but most said Biden\'s issue positions were about right. Florida likely voters said they trusted Biden over Sanders by a wide margin — 59% to 37% — to handle Social Security. anders addressed supporters in a livestreamed speech after polls closed in most of Florida and called for the country to come together as local, state and federal officials respond to the coronavirus. ""I think the main point to be made tonight is that in this moment of crisis, it is imperative that we stand together, understand that right now throughout this country, there are so many of our people wondering what\'s going to happen to me tomorrow?"" Sanders said. He added that ""this is a moment that we have got to be working together."" Sanders laid out a series of proposals he said he plans to present to Democratic leadership and said an adequate response will require an ""unprecedented"" amount of money."" Sanders estimated the price tag will top $2 trillion. The plans put forth by Sanders to bolster the response to the coronavirus include allowing Medicare to cover all medical bills during the public health crisis; increasing test kits for the coronavirus and the speed at which tests are processed; activating the National Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other military resources to help expand healthcare capacity; and using emergency authority to scale up production in the U.S. of critical supplies and protective equipment. Sanders also suggested a number of measures to mitigate the economic impacts for American workers and their families, including providing a $2,000 monthly cash payment to every household for the duration of the crisis, expanding Meals on Wheels and food stamps and placing a moratorium on evictions, foreclosures and utility shutoffs. ""We must make certain that the government is getting this money into the hands of working families and the most vulnerable as quickly as possible,"" he said. Sanders said the economic crisis should not be ""another money-making opportunity"" for large corporations and Wall Street. ""We\'ve got some major crisis, but I have the strong belief that if we work together, if we do not turn to fear and panic, but if we understand that the way we solve this is by going forward as one people, remembering those who are hurting tonight and will be hurting in the future,"" he said. ""This is the richest country in the history world. This is a country with unbelievable energy, with unbelievable talent, with incredible resources. We can do it. We can address this crisis, we can minimize the pain and let us do just that."" CBS News projects Biden will win Florida, the biggest prize in Tuesday\'s primaries with 219 pledged delegates. Florida has a large Hispanic population, and Biden has previously struggled to gain support from Hispanic voters in states which have already held primaries, like Nevada. The delegate allocation at poll closing in Florida was 100 delegates for Biden, and 27 for Sanders, according to CBS News\' analysis. All polls are now closed in Florida and in Illinois, after an election day marked by fears about the spread of the coronavirus. Polls close in Arizona at 10 p.m. ET. The Ohio primary has been pushed back until June 2. Sanders will livestream remarks about the coronavirus crisis at 7:15 p.m., shortly after polls close in Florida. The speech will address how the ""response to the outbreak should put working families and the most vulnerable first,"" according to a press release from the campaign. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democrats said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Biden and Sanders have made remarks outlining their plans to respond to the crisis. The Florida Democratic Party said the number of Democrats who have voted early in person and by mail has exceeded turnout in the primaries in 2016. According to the state party, 141,560 more Democrats voted by mail this year than they did in the last presidential primary. Additionally, 74,031 more Democrats voted early in person this year than in 2016. The Florida Democratic Party also said it enrolled nearly 500,000 new Democrats into vote-by-mail in 2018. The party said that the coronavirus pandemic, which has impacted voting in states holding their contests today, demonstrates the need for the government to revamp voting methods. As the country deals with a health care crisis, the issue of health care remains on voters\' minds. In Arizona, Florida, and Illinois, voters picked health care as the issue that would be most important in determining their vote, according to CBS News primary polls. The second most important issue among voters in each of the three states was income inequality, followed by climate change and race relations. Likely Democratic voters in Illinois said they are also worried about the economy, primary polls show. More than eight in 10 are least somewhat concerned about the national economy over the next year. In the three states where voters will head to the polls Tuesday, most said they prefer the Democratic nominee be someone who can beat Trump — at least six in 10 in each state— over someone they agree with on major issues, according to CBS News primary polls. As has been the case throughout this campaign, there are high levels of dissatisfaction toward the Trump administration among the Democratic primary electorate. Large majorities of likely voters in Florida and Illinois and those who voted by mail in Arizona said they feel angry about the Trump administration. Among likely Democratic voters in Illinois, more Sanders supporters said they would be unhappy about Biden being the nominee than Biden supporters would be if Sanders became the nominee, according to primary polls. Fifty-four percent of Sanders supporters would be dissatisfied or upset if Biden won the nomination, compared to 37% of Biden backers who would feel that way if Sanders became the nominee. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democratic voters said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Among those polled in Florida, 71% said they trusted Biden more, compared to 23% who said Sanders is the candidate they trust to handle a major crisis. In Illinois, 64% of Democratic voters selected Biden while 31% said Sanders is more trusted, and in Arizona, 63% said they trust Biden more to handle a major crisis compared to 31%, who pointed to Sanders. The Democratic National Committee is calling on states that haven\'t yet held their primaries to vote by mail, as coronavirus threatens future primaries. ""The simplest tool is vote by mail, which is already in use in a number of states and should be made available to all registered voters. States using vote by mail should proactively mail ballots to registered voters, where feasible, and should count all ballots as long as they are postmarked by the date of the primary,"" DNC chair Tom Perez said in a statement on Wednesday. Where in-person voting can take place in accordance with health guidelines, states should expand the days and hours of early voting to cut down on lines, Perez added. According to CBS News primary polls, nearly all likely voters in Illinois expressed at least some concern about the effects of the coronavirus, including more than half who said they are very concerned about it. Most likely voters of all ages in Illinois said they are concerned, but older voters are particularly so: 62% of voters ages 45 and over say they are very concerned, compared to 38% of younger voters. Women (59%) were also more likely than men (46%) to be very concerned. Some voters, meanwhile, said the coronavirus could change their decision to vote. In Florida, among those who said they would definitely vote and planned to do so in person on Election Day, 15% said it was very or somewhat likely that they could change their decision to vote. In Illinois, that figure was 9%, according to primary polls. The Biden campaign is optimistic it will walk away from Tuesday\'s primaries with a wider delegate lead than it had going into the contests despite the challenges to voter turnout raised because of the coronavirus. ""It would take a drastic, historically-incomparable swing for Senator Sanders to win more delegates than Biden today or to close the delegate differential,"" the campaign said in a memo released Tuesday. Heading into the four primaries held on Tuesday, Biden led Sanders by more than 100 delegates. The former vice president\'s campaign also noted that while fewer people may head to the polls on Election Day because of the coronavirus, it expects overall turnout to match that of past elections. ""While voter turnout on Election Day itself may be lower due to COVID-19 concerns, we believe that, with early vote and vote by mail, overall turnout will be roughly on pace for 2016 in Arizona and Florida and roughly on pace for 2018 in Illinois, and that voter turnout in all three states will reflect the population at large,"" the campaign said in the memo. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, on Tuesday defended the decision to keep the polls open despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. ""There are people out there today who want to say, \'Oh, it\'s a crisis, bend the rules and overstep your authority,\'"" Pritzker said. ""Let me tell you this, It is exactly in times like these, when the constitutional boundaries of our democracy should be respected above all else. And if people want to criticize me for that, well, go ahead. I\'ll wear it like a badge of honor."" Earlier Tuesday, Chicago Board of Elections spokesman Jim Allen said he urged Pritzker to prohibit voting in person and go fully vote-by-mail. Allen later apologized for the remarks. The Chicago Board of Elections said they said they\'ve had to move in total 200 precincts, with some locations in the city dropping out as soon as this morning (these cases were immediately moved to a new location). In Chicago, 126,499 votes have been cast through 2 p.m. ET, with a surge after the first two hours. Biden tweeted a reminder about polls being open in Arizona, Florida and Illinois. ""I encourage folks to vote by mail or curbside vote if you can,"" Biden wrote. ""If you vote in person, please wash your hands, don\'t touch your face, and stay 6\' from others in line."" Maryland Governor Larry Hogan announced at a press conference on Tuesday morning that the state will move its primary from April 28 until June 2. The state Board of Elections issued a statement shortly after that ""fully supports"" Hogan\'s decision. The decision follows similar action in Georgia, Kentucky and Louisiana. In a last-minute move on Monday, Ohio postponed its primary. The Ohio State Supreme Court denied a challenge to Ohio\'s primary delay filed by Wood County judicial candidate Corey Speweik, who was fighting the state of Ohio\'s decision to shut down Tuesday\'s primary and postpone voting until June over concern about the spread of the coronavirus. The process leading up to the delay was chaotic. With less than 12 hours to go before polls were scheduled to open in Ohio for the state\'s presidential primary election, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, announced polls would remain closed Tuesday amid concerns over the coronavirus. The decision came just hours after a Franklin County judge denied a request backed by the governor and secretary of state to delay the election. The Ohio Democratic Party said in a statement Tuesday that although voting did not seem feasible, it hoped the primary would be rescheduled for earlier than June 2. ""Given the chaos, confusion and mixed messages of the past 24 hours, it\'s clearly impossible for in-person voting to move forward today in Ohio,"" the party said in a statement. ""The Ohio Democratic Party strongly supports concluding the primary election earlier than June 2. Extending for that long is highly problematic for any number for reasons, and it is not at all clear that in-person voting will be possible on that date anyway,"" the statement continued. At a news conference Monday, in response to a question about the possible impact of the coronavirus outbreak, President Trump said delaying elections would be ""not a very good thing."" ""I\'d leave that up to the states,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Postponing elections is not a very good thing … I think postponing is unnecessary."" A poll by Monmouth University released on Monday showed Biden with a double-digit advantage over Sanders in Arizona. Among voters likely to participate in the primary, Biden was supported by 51% to Sanders\' 31%. Sanders leads among Latino voters by seven points, and among voters under 50 years old by wide margins. But this is more than offset by Biden\'s strong advantage among larger voter blocs, including white voters and those aged 50 and over. In head-to-head matchups with the president, Biden had a small edge Mr. Trump, but the president was virtually tied with Sanders. Although Arizona has long been a solid red state, it could be a battleground this November. Mr. Trump only won the state by 4 points against Hillary Clinton in 2016. In the Senate race, Democrat Mark Kelly had a 6-point edge in the poll over incumbent Martha McSally. "',
        AnswerContent: '"Check back for updates as polls close in three states amid the coronavirus pandemic. Former Vice President Joe Biden swept all three states voting Tuesday in a series of primaries that were heavily influenced by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. His last win of the night came in Arizona, where the Associated Press projected a victory through voter surveys. Biden secured early projected wins in Florida and Illinois, where he was long heavily favored to win, and he captured the state of Arizona shortly after polls there closed at 10 p.m. EDT. In all, more than 440 delegates were up for grabs in the latest round of voting, and Biden’s projected victories handed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders a formidable challenge to catch up. It was the first series of primaries to take place amid the national state of emergency President Donald Trump declared over the coronavirus pandemic, a circumstance that had the potential to upend the candidates’ messages as well as the technical process of running a primary election. The Democratic primary schedule has a bit of a lull for the next month. Puerto Rico holds a primary March 29. April 4 primaries include Hawaii with 24 delegates, Alaska with 15 and Wyoming’s caucuses with 14. Wisconsin has a primary April 7. And then on April 28, five states will make their choices, including New York with 274 delegates and Pennsylvania with 186 delegates. Ohioans were set to cast their ballots on Tuesday but state officials there announced they would postpone the election until sometime after the outbreak had passed. “This pandemic has impacted every aspect of our lives, and every aspect of this campaign,” Biden said in a video streamed from his home in Delaware, where he eschewed the traditional rally to deliver his election night remarks. “It’s at moments like these that we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans.” Both candidates avoided attacks on each other, or even discussing the latest contours of the race.    “In this moment of crisis it is imperative that we stand together,” Sanders said in his own video message. “This is a moment that we’ve got to be working together.” Heading into the election, Biden had a better than 153-delegate lead over Sanders.    Trump, who never faced a significant challenge, also swept the primaries Tuesday and exceeded the 1,276 delegates needed to become the GOP’s presumptive nominee. As Arizona’s polls closed Tuesday with uncertain results, former Vice President Joe Biden looked to add to his Democratic primary wins in Florida and Illinois against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, according to Associated Press projections from voter surveys. Biden’s victories came on the same night President Donald Trump locked up the Republican nomination for his re-election. Biden said from his home in Wilmington, Del., that the victories demonstrated a broad coalition to beat Trump, including blacks, Hispanics, suburban women and veterans. He commended Sanders’ supporters and said they share a vision for affordable health care, a need to reduce income inequality and to fight climate change. “Sen. Sanders and I may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision,” Biden said. “Sen. Sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all of these issues.” Florida offered the biggest prize for Biden, with 219 pledged delegates. At stake in Illinois were 155 delegates and in Arizona were 67 delegates. Ohio, with 136 delegates, postponed its vote because of concerns about coronavirus. The virus declared a worldwide pandemic wreaked havoc with the primaries in all three states, according to voting advocates. Poll workers failed to show up to work. Election officials closed polling places for lack of staff and to move them away from residential facilities for the elderly. And workers lacked wipes and hand sanitizer to reduce the spread of disease. “This pandemic has impacted every aspect of our life, and every aspect of this campaign,” Biden said. “Tackling this pandemic is a national emergency akin to fighting a war.” But the victories built on Biden’s lead toward meeting the 1,991 delegates needed to clinch the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. Biden had at least 1,121 delegates, compared to 839 for Sanders, according to an AP tabulation. Political experts say the remaining states offer little chance for Sanders to make large enough strides to overtake Biden. For example, the Florida win continued Biden’s successful march across the south, after South Carolina revived his campaign Feb. 29. He swept southern states on March 3 Super Tuesday. Still ahead are Georgia May 19 and Louisiana on June 20. The Democratic primary schedule has a bit of a lull for the next month. Puerto Rico holds a primary March 29. April 4 primaries include Hawaii with 24 delegates, Alaska with 15 and Wyoming’s caucuses with 14. Wisconsin has a primary April 7. And then on April 28, five states will make their choices, including New York with 274 delegates and Pennsylvania with 186 delegates. By winning the Florida and Illinois Republican primaries Tuesday night, President Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican party presidential nominee. He exceeded the 1,276 delegates needed to secure the nomination. “The Republican Party is more unified and energized than ever before and it’s because of President Trump’s leadership and clear record of accomplishment on behalf of all Americans,” Brad Parscale, Trump’s 2020 campaign manager said in a statement. Trump easily won every state that held a contest in the Republican primary. Former Vice President Joe Biden has beaten Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Illinois Democratic primary, according to Associated Press projections from voter surveys. The projected outcome, though not unexpected, will further cement Biden’s place as the clear frontrunner in the race for the Democratic nomination. The former vice president started his day Tuesday with a more than 153-delegate lead over Sanders. Voting in Illinois was set to wrap up at 8 p.m. EDT but was extended by an hour in dozens of Cook County precincts. Polling this month had put Biden ahead in Illinois with a large double-digit margin, and so the outcome in the Prairie State had long been forecast. On the other hand, coronavirus fears and early reports of low turnout in the state had raised questions about the predictive value of recent polling. There are 155 delegates at stake in Illinois, the second-largest delegate haul of the three states in play on Tuesday.  Voters in Florida and Arizona were also picking a Democratic candidate Tuesday in the first series of primary elections since the coronavirus has been thrust to the forefront of American consciousness. Biden posted a tweet Tuesday encouraging voters to cast a ballot curbside or by mail, if possible. Former Vice President Joe Biden has beaten Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in Florida’s Democratic primary, the biggest prize among Tuesday’s primaries with 219 pledged delegates, according to Associated Press projections from voter surveys.  The victory continues Biden’s sweep of southern states in the quest to challenge President Donald Trump in November. Illinois was also voting with 155 delegates and Arizona had 67 delegates at stake. Ohio, with 136 delegates, postponed its vote because of concerns about coronavirus. Biden’s win came as no surprise, after leading an average of statewide polling through Tuesday with 64% to 25% for Sanders, according to the tracking site FiveThirtyEight.com. One key distinction between the candidates in Florida, which is home to about 1.5 million Cuban Americans, was over U.S. policy toward the island nation.  Sanders, a Democratic socialist, has praised the literacy programs of Fidel Castro, the late dictator whose control over Cuba led to an estrangement from the U.S. for 50 years. But Biden criticized Sanders for supposing communists in Cuba and other authoritarian regimes. The Chicago Board of Elections is fighting to extend voting in five precincts by an hour Tuesday night amid low turnout due to the coronavirus outbreak. Reports of numerous polling places without necessary equipment or poll workers popped up during the day, as election officials blamed the state’s governor not postponing the primary in light of the outbreak. Jim Allen, spokesman for the Chicago Board of Election, told reporters the board asked the state last week to either delay the primary or move to a mail-in only race, multiple media outlets reported. The governor\'s office has disputed this ""as a lie."" According to the Chicago Board of Elections, those five precincts “will be open until 8 pm pending court order. All remaining precincts close at 7 pm.” Across the state of Illinois, and the country, efforts to contain the virus has escalated with thousands of schools temporarily closing, and restaurants shuttering to only provide take out or delivery services.  Trump on Monday issued guidelines that called for Americans to avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people. The 2020 Democratic primary broke the city’s record for early voting in a primary, with more than 145,000 people going to the polls early, according to the Chicago Tribune. But, election Day voter turnout in Chicago remained dismal through the night, with the voter turnout at just over 267,000 people of 6 pm.  The Chicago Board of Elections tweeted earlier: “This primary is happening in extraordinary times that we have never seen before. We admire the strength of all Chicagoans that are helping ensure our democracy continues today.” The Ohio Democratic Party sued election officials on Tuesday over their unusual decision to cancel in-person voting in the Buckeye State’s presidential primary because of the coronavirus, the latest legal fight to crop up over the move. Democrats sued Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, arguing he does not have the legal authority to reschedule a make-up election absent action from state lawmakers. Instead of setting a new election unilaterally, the suit seeks an extension of absentee balloting until late April. Democrats, who filed the suit in the Ohio Supreme Court, said the litigation was intended in part to preserve the option of a future election. Without it, they said, they are concerned that they might not get another shot at in-person voting.  ""This primary election must move forward,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. “Yesterday’s actions did not create unchecked authority with the governor or secretary of state to run a new election."" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced that the state would push back its election, originally scheduled for Tuesday, to June 2 because of coronavirus fears. But Democratic officials have urged states that have yet to hold their primaries to avoid changing dates. Ohio is one of several states, along with Louisiana, Kentucky and Maryland, that have postponed voting because of the virus. National party officials have requested that states “use a variety of other critical mechanisms” rather than moving primaries. Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez said Tuesday that it is “critical that states provide clarity and not confusion, which could lead to disenfranchising voters.” CHICAGO -- Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Chicago election officials feuded Tuesday over the state’s decision to push ahead with voting despite health concerns from the coronavirus pandemic. Election Day voter turnout in Chicago was dismal – around 126,000 by 1 p.m. – below even local mayoral elections in the city and one-third the turnout pace of the 2020 primary election. In the separate suburban Cook County, 119,000 had voted by 3 p.m., also vastly below past primary turnouts. Jim Allen, spokesman for the Chicago Board of Election, told reporters the board asked the state last week to either delay the primary or move to a mail-in only race, multiple media outlets reported. That drew a sharply worded tweet from Anne Caprara, Pritzker’s chief of staff: “This is a lie. And frankly, given what we are dealing with in this moment, I’m disgusted that Jim Allen would lie like this,” Caprara said. “We offered them the national guard, young volunteers and assistance with keeping polling places clean.” In another tweet, she added: “The Governor has been trying to balance continuity of government, not disenfranchising people who already voted, avoiding a legal crisis & keeping everyone safe. The Chicago Board of Elections have been worried about scoring cheap political points.” Although Election Day turnout will likely remain low in Chicago, the overall numbers could be lifted by strong early-voting figures. The 2020 Democratic primary broke the city’s record for early voting in a primary, with more than 145,000 people going to the polls early, according to the Chicago Tribune. It eclipsed the 140,000 who voted early in Chicago in the 2016 Democratic Primary. The city also broke a World War II-era record with 118,000 vote-by-mail ballot requests. Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden is the heavy favorite to win the most delegates in Illinois. The last two polls taken of likely Democratic voters in Illinois each found Biden ahead of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders by more than 20 percentage points. The Democratic National Committee is urging states who have yet to hold their primaries to avoid changing primary dates due to the coronavirus pandemic. DNC chairman Tom Perez said in a statement that states should instead  “use a variety of other critical mechanisms that will make voting easier and safer for voters and election officials alike,” instead “of moving primaries to later in the cycle when timing around the virus remains unpredictable.” He noted that states should use a vote-by-mail system or if they can still vote in-person under public health guidelines, then they should expand days and hours of early voting to reduce lines on Election Day.  ""As our country deals with the uncertainty of COVID-19, it is critical that states provide clarity and not confusion, which could lead to disenfranchising voters,” Perez said in the statement. The statement comes less than 24 hours after Ohio postponed their primary election last minute. The state’s primary was supposed to be held Tuesday and a new date has yet to be set. Several other states, including Louisiana, Kentucky and Maryland, have also postponed their primary dates. “What happened in Ohio last night has only bred more chaos and confusion, and the Democratic Party leadership in Ohio is working tirelessly to protect the right to vote,” Perez said in a statement. “Eligible voters deserve certainty, safety, and accessibility.”  “The right to vote is the foundation of our democracy, and we must do everything we can to protect and expand that right instead of bringing our democratic process to a halt,” Perez concluded. In a primary election suddenly consumed by fears about the coronavirus pandemic, seven in ten Florida voters said they trust former Vice President Joe Biden more than Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to handle a crisis, according to an NBC report on the poll. The results were widely consistent across the states voting Tuesday, the first to cast a ballot amid an outbreak of COVID-19 that has disrupted the routines of millions of Americans. More than six in 10 Illinois voters and 63% of Arizona voters said they would trust Biden more than Sanders to handle a crisis. Because of the virus and increasingly stringent requests for social distancing, the National Election Pool did not conduct in-person exit polls for Tuesday\'s primaries, NBC reported. Instead, the outlets conducted a telephone survey of voters before Tuesday\'s vote. After some Florida polling sites opened late Tuesday, Florida election officials defended their decision to press forward with its presidential primaries amid a global coronavirus pandemic. Secretary of State Laurel Lee said one precinct in Broward County opened late but was ""up and running,"" The Tallahassee Democrat reported, and there were ""isolated precincts in Palm Beach County that have had some challenges."" ""All other counties reported on-time opening of all voting locations around the state,"" she said. Lee said voters who did not want to go to polling sites over health concerns could pick up vote-by-mail ballots and turn them in by 7 p.m. EDT. A group of civils rights organizations, including the New Florida Majority, LatinoJustice and Dream Defenders, sued Lee and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in federal court Monday, seeking to extend vote-by-mail deadlines through March 27, to allow people concerned about going to precincts a chance to vote. WASHINGTON – Democratic primary voters in Florida, Illinois and Arizona found some confusion at polling places that moved or closed because of coronavirus, but voting advocates said Tuesday that turnout might still eclipse the 2016 primary. Alex Gulotta, Arizona state director of the advocacy group All Voting Is Local, said concerns about coronavirus prompted officials to close polling places, which confused voters about where to go. In Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, the number of polling places dropped from 240 to 151, but anyone who is registered could vote at any of them. But while in-person voting was running low at about 20% of expectations, more people voted already by mail than in 2016, Gulotta said. “We’ve had enormous turnout by mail,” he said. “Turnout has been very low today, but overall, voting is more than 2016.” Jay Young, executive director of Common Cause Illinois, said problems emerged early with election judges who didn’t show up and polling places closed. Poll workers complained about a lack of wipes or hand sanitizer, he said. “Here in Illinois, it’s been a hectic and trying day,” he said, with in-person turnout running about one-third the rate of previous primaries. Liza McClenaghan, board chair for Common Cause Florida, said a number of poll workers in Palm Beach County didn’t report to work Tuesday. Some had keys to polling places, which prevented them opening, and others had keys to equipment, which prevented using them, she said. The county invited voters to visit one of four election offices, or to mail in ballots. But McClenaghan said elderly voters have been asking where to vote as they discovered closed polling places and were suspicious of having mail-in ballots delivered by strangers. “We’ve had a dog’s breakfast about information for poll closings,” McClenaghan said. “We hope things improve shortly.” Karen Hobert Flynn, president of Common Cause, said the challenges in the primaries will give election officials an opportunity to find remedies such as allowing more mail-in voting by the November election. “Today we’re faced with a challenge unlike anything we’ve seen in our 50 years of advocacy, a global pandemic where all 50 states have now declared a state of emergency,” she said. WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. – Palm Beach County, Florida faced a shortage in poll workers Tuesday morning as Florida held its presidential primary amid the nation’s coronavirus pandemic. Some voters found closed doors when they arrived at their voting sites, The Palm Beach Post reported. Some locations opened late but others remained closed, prompting officials to allow voters pick up vote-by-mail ballots at any of the county’s election offices. Ahead of Election Day, around 800 poll workers notified Palm Beach elected officials they would not work because of concerns about the COVID-19 outbreak, leaving nearly 3,000 workers to cover Palm Beach County’s 454 voting sites. Penny Powell of West Palm Beach told The Post she went to her polling place, Pine Jog Environmental Center, to find it closed. She said a park worker sent her to the Supervisor of Elections\' main office, where she was able to vote. “They’re both close to each other so it wasn’t out of the way,” she said. “So I’m good with it.” She did not know why her location was not open. Former Vice President Joe Biden is heavily favored to defeat Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in Florida’s Democratic presidential primary. But turnout is a major wild card, particularly with the possibility it could disproportionately dissuade senior voters from the polls. Biden performs better among old voters while young voters overwhelmingly back Sanders. At one Palm Beach County location, the King’s Point clubhouse west of Delray Beach, only 32 people had voted as of noon. Poll workers there said they expected a low turnout because of the coronavirus. But at other locations, voters said they waited in line for nearly an hour. As coronavirus precautions, voters are told to space out six feet apart as they wait to vote. WASHINGTON – Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced Tuesday his state would postpone its primary, moving it from April 28 to June 2. The move comes as Arizona, Florida, and Illinois hold their Democratic presidential primary elections Tuesday. Ohio closed its polling places after Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, declared a ""health emergency."" ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at a unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said in a release late Monday.  The virus, which has been named COVID-19, already appears to have depressed turnout in morning voting in Chicago. The Chicago Board of Elections said there was ""extremely low turnout"" in morning voting. From 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. EDT, only 10,000 votes were cast, the Board said, as opposed to 30,000 votes that would be cast in a low turnout election.  Former Vice President Joe Biden currently leads the national delegate count with 898, whereas Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has 745 delegates. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, has two delegates.  Former Vice President Joe Biden is heavily favored to defeat Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders as Arizona Democrats head to the polls for the state’s primary election amid the global pandemic. Maricopa County election officials, in reaction to the coronavirus, closed 80 polling places and made the remaining 151 voting locations ""vote centers,” allowing voters to vote at any location, not just the one in their neighborhood.   Sanders visited Phoenix earlier this month to bolster his campaign. He is counting on the state\'s significant Latino population to provide a boost for him, but recent polling suggests he remains well behind here. --Ronald J. Hansen and Yvonne Wingett Sanchez, Arizona Republic."',

        ArticleContent: '"Joe Biden swept all three primaries on Tuesday night in Arizona, Florida and Illinois, CBS News projects. The contests took place amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis that led Ohio officials to postpone their primary, which had also been scheduled for Tuesday. In remarks after his early win in Florida, Biden, speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, said his campaign appeared to have had a ""very good night,"" but he also spoke about the coronavirus crisis. He told Americans that ""it\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy."" Bernie Sanders gave remarks via livestream earlier in the night. He focused mainly on the coronavirus crisis and highlighted unity. Tuesday\'s lopsided results will expand the divide in delegates between Biden and Sanders. It\'s unclear when the next primary contests will be held. Georgia, which had been set to vote on March 24, has postponed its primary, as did Louisiana, which was scheduled to go to the polls on April 4. As of 12 a.m. ET on Wednesday, Biden had increased his lead to 291 delegates. Biden now has 1,093 delegates to Sanders\' 802. To get the nomination, the Democratic candidate will need 1,991 delegates. According to CBS News primary polling in Arizona, the most important candidate quality for voters was being able to unite the country. Of those voters, 65% said they voted for Biden, while just 16% went for Sanders. The poll was mostly of voters who already voted by mail and includes those who said they were likely to show up at polls today. Like Florida and Illinois voters, 69% of Arizona voters saw Biden as the candidate with the best chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to 26% who believed the same of Sanders. Biden was also seen as the candidate trusted more to handle a major crisis. Biden led among white voters by 51% to 32%. Hispanic voters were more evenly divided: Biden 45% to Sanders 44%. CBS News projects the former vice president wins the Arizona primary, finalizing Biden\'s sweep of the three states that voted. Sixty-seven pledged delegates are up for grabs in Arizona. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose cheered the decision to postpone the state\'s primary election until June 2, saying it ""saved Ohio lives."" ""By preventing Ohioans from going to polling locations, we averted a situation which would have gone against the most recent scientific evidence available and could have dangerously advanced the spread of coronavirus across Ohio,"" the two said in a joining statement. ""It is abundantly clear that it would have been impossible to carry out a fair, accessible, and safe election today."" DeWine and LaRose stressed that Ohio voters should have a ""significant"" amount of time to cast mail-in absentee ballots and also vote in-person. Less than 12 hours before the polls were set to open in Ohio, DeWine announced that Dr. Amy Acton, director of the Ohio Department of Health, would be issuing an order to close polls ""to avoid the imminent threat with the high probability of widespread exposure to COVID-19."" As of 11 p.m. ET, Biden is leading in every county in Florida. Although Hillary Clinton won the primary in 2016, Sanders won nine counties in the northern part of the state in that contest. The Arizona secretary of state has revealed that personal information related to some protected voters was erroneously included in reports generated from the state\'s voter registration database. Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said in a statement that the error was not the result of a security breach or vulnerability. Hobbs said her office was notified from a county official that an early ballot report they compiled included ""protected voters,"" or those whose information is protected due to their jobs or if they were victims of certain crimes. Seventy-eight names were mistakenly included in the reports, the secretary of state\'s office said, and the office has asked county officials to contact those who were directly impacted. The early ballot reports are produced using data from the state\'s voter registration database, and the reports are provided by counties to political parties during elections. Hobb\'s office said the process for producing reports from the voter registration database has also been updated to prevent future errors. Biden celebrated his early wins in Illinois and Florida with a solemn address to supporters calling for the country to come together in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, while also thanking Bernie Sanders and his supporters for the ""remarkable passion"" they have brought to the Democratic race. Speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, with a backdrop of black cloth and flanked by two American flags, Biden remarked that his campaign ""has had a very good night"" and is moving closer to securing the Democratic presidential nomination. He also thanked election officials and poll workers in the three states with in-person voting for ensuring people could cast their ballots while also remaining safe. ""It\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy,"" he said. Biden said that his campaign is building a broad coalition that includes support from African-Americans, the Latino community, labor, firefighters, teachers, suburban women and others. ""We\'re doing it with a common vision,"" he said, adding that he and Sanders share that vision. The former vice president also thanked Sanders and his supporters for bringing ""remarkable passion and tenacity"" to issues like healthcare, income inequality and climate change, and delivered a message directly to young Sanders supporters. ""To young votes who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you, I know what\'s at stake. I know what we have to do,"" he said. ""Our goal as a campaign and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party and to unify the nation."" Biden also praised Americans for altering their lives as public health officials rush to limit the spread of the coronavirus, saying that Americans are ""ordinary people doing extraordinary things when the need arises and today we are moving quickly to adapt our routines to meet this challenge."" ""It\'s in moments like these we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans,"" Biden said. ""The coronavirus doesn\'t care if you\'re a Democrat or Republican. It will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender or your zip code. It will touch people in positions of power as well as the most vulnerable people in our society. We\'re all in this together."" A large number of likely voters in Illinois, 87%, said they were concerned about coronavirus, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to the primary. Biden received the support of likely voters concerned about the coronavirus by about 2-to-1. Similar percentages of likely voters are worried about the direction of the nation\'s economy in 2021, and Biden received their support by a similar margin. Sixty-four percent of likely voters in the Illinois primary picked Biden over Sanders as the person they would trust more to handle a major crisis. Likely primary voters in Illinois said beating President Trump was more important to them than having a candidate who agreed with them on the issues, and 69% said Biden would have the better chance to defeat the incumbent president in November. Polling shows Biden with a commanding lead among black likely voters – getting 70% of those polled – but he also received a majority vote of white likely voters as well, securing the support of both whites with and without college degrees. He received the support of over half of men and nearly two-thirds of women. The generational divide seen throughout this election cycle was also apparent in Illinois, with Sanders taking the vast majority of likely voters under 45, and Biden getting the strong support among older voters. But older likely voters significantly outnumbered their younger counterparts: more than six in ten likely voters were over the age of 45. And while Sanders maintains strong support of likely voters who say they are very liberal – getting nearly two-thirds support among this group – they made up just over a quarter of those polled. Biden garnered strong support among likely voters who said they were ""somewhat liberal"", and did particularly well among moderates. CBS News estimates Illinois leans toward Biden. At the moment, Chicago looks to be very close between Biden and Sanders, but many more votes are expected to be counted. The current delegate allocation in Illinois has Biden with 33 delegates and Sanders with 21. There are 155 total delegates at stake in Illinois. Following wins in the Republican primaries in Illinois and Florida, President Trump has secured the delegates needed to win the Republican presidential nomination, CBS News projects. President Trump has clinched the Republican nomination.https://t.co/E3KhCZjESV pic.twitter.com/YNT7WliBd0 — CBS News (@CBSNews) March 18, 2020 Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel offered congratulations to Mr. Trump for ""officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for president."" Congratulations to Donald J. Trump on officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for President! His home state of Florida just delivered him the delegates he needed. Our party is united, our grassroots movement is fired up, and we are ready for FOUR MORE YEARS! pic.twitter.com/B4X9IaQp7f — Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) March 18, 2020 Mr. Trump had several early challengers for the Republican nomination, though most dropped out of the race. Only former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld remains in the race. Most likely voters in Florida said electability was a priority for them going into the primary, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to March 17. Seventy-three percent of likely voters also think Biden would have a good chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to just 21% who picked Sanders. Voters over age 45 were more likely to say they support Biden. Those who want the next president to return to Obama policies instead of more liberal policies said they would vote for Biden. Nearly half of Florida likely voters said Sanders\' issue positions were too liberal, but most said Biden\'s issue positions were about right. Florida likely voters said they trusted Biden over Sanders by a wide margin — 59% to 37% — to handle Social Security. anders addressed supporters in a livestreamed speech after polls closed in most of Florida and called for the country to come together as local, state and federal officials respond to the coronavirus. ""I think the main point to be made tonight is that in this moment of crisis, it is imperative that we stand together, understand that right now throughout this country, there are so many of our people wondering what\'s going to happen to me tomorrow?"" Sanders said. He added that ""this is a moment that we have got to be working together."" Sanders laid out a series of proposals he said he plans to present to Democratic leadership and said an adequate response will require an ""unprecedented"" amount of money."" Sanders estimated the price tag will top $2 trillion. The plans put forth by Sanders to bolster the response to the coronavirus include allowing Medicare to cover all medical bills during the public health crisis; increasing test kits for the coronavirus and the speed at which tests are processed; activating the National Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other military resources to help expand healthcare capacity; and using emergency authority to scale up production in the U.S. of critical supplies and protective equipment. Sanders also suggested a number of measures to mitigate the economic impacts for American workers and their families, including providing a $2,000 monthly cash payment to every household for the duration of the crisis, expanding Meals on Wheels and food stamps and placing a moratorium on evictions, foreclosures and utility shutoffs. ""We must make certain that the government is getting this money into the hands of working families and the most vulnerable as quickly as possible,"" he said. Sanders said the economic crisis should not be ""another money-making opportunity"" for large corporations and Wall Street. ""We\'ve got some major crisis, but I have the strong belief that if we work together, if we do not turn to fear and panic, but if we understand that the way we solve this is by going forward as one people, remembering those who are hurting tonight and will be hurting in the future,"" he said. ""This is the richest country in the history world. This is a country with unbelievable energy, with unbelievable talent, with incredible resources. We can do it. We can address this crisis, we can minimize the pain and let us do just that."" CBS News projects Biden will win Florida, the biggest prize in Tuesday\'s primaries with 219 pledged delegates. Florida has a large Hispanic population, and Biden has previously struggled to gain support from Hispanic voters in states which have already held primaries, like Nevada. The delegate allocation at poll closing in Florida was 100 delegates for Biden, and 27 for Sanders, according to CBS News\' analysis. All polls are now closed in Florida and in Illinois, after an election day marked by fears about the spread of the coronavirus. Polls close in Arizona at 10 p.m. ET. The Ohio primary has been pushed back until June 2. Sanders will livestream remarks about the coronavirus crisis at 7:15 p.m., shortly after polls close in Florida. The speech will address how the ""response to the outbreak should put working families and the most vulnerable first,"" according to a press release from the campaign. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democrats said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Biden and Sanders have made remarks outlining their plans to respond to the crisis. The Florida Democratic Party said the number of Democrats who have voted early in person and by mail has exceeded turnout in the primaries in 2016. According to the state party, 141,560 more Democrats voted by mail this year than they did in the last presidential primary. Additionally, 74,031 more Democrats voted early in person this year than in 2016. The Florida Democratic Party also said it enrolled nearly 500,000 new Democrats into vote-by-mail in 2018. The party said that the coronavirus pandemic, which has impacted voting in states holding their contests today, demonstrates the need for the government to revamp voting methods. As the country deals with a health care crisis, the issue of health care remains on voters\' minds. In Arizona, Florida, and Illinois, voters picked health care as the issue that would be most important in determining their vote, according to CBS News primary polls. The second most important issue among voters in each of the three states was income inequality, followed by climate change and race relations. Likely Democratic voters in Illinois said they are also worried about the economy, primary polls show. More than eight in 10 are least somewhat concerned about the national economy over the next year. In the three states where voters will head to the polls Tuesday, most said they prefer the Democratic nominee be someone who can beat Trump — at least six in 10 in each state— over someone they agree with on major issues, according to CBS News primary polls. As has been the case throughout this campaign, there are high levels of dissatisfaction toward the Trump administration among the Democratic primary electorate. Large majorities of likely voters in Florida and Illinois and those who voted by mail in Arizona said they feel angry about the Trump administration. Among likely Democratic voters in Illinois, more Sanders supporters said they would be unhappy about Biden being the nominee than Biden supporters would be if Sanders became the nominee, according to primary polls. Fifty-four percent of Sanders supporters would be dissatisfied or upset if Biden won the nomination, compared to 37% of Biden backers who would feel that way if Sanders became the nominee. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democratic voters said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Among those polled in Florida, 71% said they trusted Biden more, compared to 23% who said Sanders is the candidate they trust to handle a major crisis. In Illinois, 64% of Democratic voters selected Biden while 31% said Sanders is more trusted, and in Arizona, 63% said they trust Biden more to handle a major crisis compared to 31%, who pointed to Sanders. The Democratic National Committee is calling on states that haven\'t yet held their primaries to vote by mail, as coronavirus threatens future primaries. ""The simplest tool is vote by mail, which is already in use in a number of states and should be made available to all registered voters. States using vote by mail should proactively mail ballots to registered voters, where feasible, and should count all ballots as long as they are postmarked by the date of the primary,"" DNC chair Tom Perez said in a statement on Wednesday. Where in-person voting can take place in accordance with health guidelines, states should expand the days and hours of early voting to cut down on lines, Perez added. According to CBS News primary polls, nearly all likely voters in Illinois expressed at least some concern about the effects of the coronavirus, including more than half who said they are very concerned about it. Most likely voters of all ages in Illinois said they are concerned, but older voters are particularly so: 62% of voters ages 45 and over say they are very concerned, compared to 38% of younger voters. Women (59%) were also more likely than men (46%) to be very concerned. Some voters, meanwhile, said the coronavirus could change their decision to vote. In Florida, among those who said they would definitely vote and planned to do so in person on Election Day, 15% said it was very or somewhat likely that they could change their decision to vote. In Illinois, that figure was 9%, according to primary polls. The Biden campaign is optimistic it will walk away from Tuesday\'s primaries with a wider delegate lead than it had going into the contests despite the challenges to voter turnout raised because of the coronavirus. ""It would take a drastic, historically-incomparable swing for Senator Sanders to win more delegates than Biden today or to close the delegate differential,"" the campaign said in a memo released Tuesday. Heading into the four primaries held on Tuesday, Biden led Sanders by more than 100 delegates. The former vice president\'s campaign also noted that while fewer people may head to the polls on Election Day because of the coronavirus, it expects overall turnout to match that of past elections. ""While voter turnout on Election Day itself may be lower due to COVID-19 concerns, we believe that, with early vote and vote by mail, overall turnout will be roughly on pace for 2016 in Arizona and Florida and roughly on pace for 2018 in Illinois, and that voter turnout in all three states will reflect the population at large,"" the campaign said in the memo. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, on Tuesday defended the decision to keep the polls open despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. ""There are people out there today who want to say, \'Oh, it\'s a crisis, bend the rules and overstep your authority,\'"" Pritzker said. ""Let me tell you this, It is exactly in times like these, when the constitutional boundaries of our democracy should be respected above all else. And if people want to criticize me for that, well, go ahead. I\'ll wear it like a badge of honor."" Earlier Tuesday, Chicago Board of Elections spokesman Jim Allen said he urged Pritzker to prohibit voting in person and go fully vote-by-mail. Allen later apologized for the remarks. The Chicago Board of Elections said they said they\'ve had to move in total 200 precincts, with some locations in the city dropping out as soon as this morning (these cases were immediately moved to a new location). In Chicago, 126,499 votes have been cast through 2 p.m. ET, with a surge after the first two hours. Biden tweeted a reminder about polls being open in Arizona, Florida and Illinois. ""I encourage folks to vote by mail or curbside vote if you can,"" Biden wrote. ""If you vote in person, please wash your hands, don\'t touch your face, and stay 6\' from others in line."" Maryland Governor Larry Hogan announced at a press conference on Tuesday morning that the state will move its primary from April 28 until June 2. The state Board of Elections issued a statement shortly after that ""fully supports"" Hogan\'s decision. The decision follows similar action in Georgia, Kentucky and Louisiana. In a last-minute move on Monday, Ohio postponed its primary. The Ohio State Supreme Court denied a challenge to Ohio\'s primary delay filed by Wood County judicial candidate Corey Speweik, who was fighting the state of Ohio\'s decision to shut down Tuesday\'s primary and postpone voting until June over concern about the spread of the coronavirus. The process leading up to the delay was chaotic. With less than 12 hours to go before polls were scheduled to open in Ohio for the state\'s presidential primary election, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, announced polls would remain closed Tuesday amid concerns over the coronavirus. The decision came just hours after a Franklin County judge denied a request backed by the governor and secretary of state to delay the election. The Ohio Democratic Party said in a statement Tuesday that although voting did not seem feasible, it hoped the primary would be rescheduled for earlier than June 2. ""Given the chaos, confusion and mixed messages of the past 24 hours, it\'s clearly impossible for in-person voting to move forward today in Ohio,"" the party said in a statement. ""The Ohio Democratic Party strongly supports concluding the primary election earlier than June 2. Extending for that long is highly problematic for any number for reasons, and it is not at all clear that in-person voting will be possible on that date anyway,"" the statement continued. At a news conference Monday, in response to a question about the possible impact of the coronavirus outbreak, President Trump said delaying elections would be ""not a very good thing."" ""I\'d leave that up to the states,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Postponing elections is not a very good thing … I think postponing is unnecessary."" A poll by Monmouth University released on Monday showed Biden with a double-digit advantage over Sanders in Arizona. Among voters likely to participate in the primary, Biden was supported by 51% to Sanders\' 31%. Sanders leads among Latino voters by seven points, and among voters under 50 years old by wide margins. But this is more than offset by Biden\'s strong advantage among larger voter blocs, including white voters and those aged 50 and over. In head-to-head matchups with the president, Biden had a small edge Mr. Trump, but the president was virtually tied with Sanders. Although Arizona has long been a solid red state, it could be a battleground this November. Mr. Trump only won the state by 4 points against Hillary Clinton in 2016. In the Senate race, Democrat Mark Kelly had a 6-point edge in the poll over incumbent Martha McSally. "',
        AnswerContent: '"Check back for updates as polls close in three states amid the coronavirus pandemic. Former Vice President Joe Biden swept all three states voting Tuesday in a series of primaries that were heavily influenced by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. His last win of the night came in Arizona, where the Associated Press projected a victory through voter surveys. Biden secured early projected wins in Florida and Illinois, where he was long heavily favored to win, and he captured the state of Arizona shortly after polls there closed at 10 p.m. EDT. In all, more than 440 delegates were up for grabs in the latest round of voting, and Biden’s projected victories handed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders a formidable challenge to catch up. It was the first series of primaries to take place amid the national state of emergency President Donald Trump declared over the coronavirus pandemic, a circumstance that had the potential to upend the candidates’ messages as well as the technical process of running a primary election. The Democratic primary schedule has a bit of a lull for the next month. Puerto Rico holds a primary March 29. April 4 primaries include Hawaii with 24 delegates, Alaska with 15 and Wyoming’s caucuses with 14. Wisconsin has a primary April 7. And then on April 28, five states will make their choices, including New York with 274 delegates and Pennsylvania with 186 delegates. Ohioans were set to cast their ballots on Tuesday but state officials there announced they would postpone the election until sometime after the outbreak had passed. “This pandemic has impacted every aspect of our lives, and every aspect of this campaign,” Biden said in a video streamed from his home in Delaware, where he eschewed the traditional rally to deliver his election night remarks. “It’s at moments like these that we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans.” Both candidates avoided attacks on each other, or even discussing the latest contours of the race.    “In this moment of crisis it is imperative that we stand together,” Sanders said in his own video message. “This is a moment that we’ve got to be working together.” Heading into the election, Biden had a better than 153-delegate lead over Sanders.    Trump, who never faced a significant challenge, also swept the primaries Tuesday and exceeded the 1,276 delegates needed to become the GOP’s presumptive nominee. As Arizona’s polls closed Tuesday with uncertain results, former Vice President Joe Biden looked to add to his Democratic primary wins in Florida and Illinois against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, according to Associated Press projections from voter surveys. Biden’s victories came on the same night President Donald Trump locked up the Republican nomination for his re-election. Biden said from his home in Wilmington, Del., that the victories demonstrated a broad coalition to beat Trump, including blacks, Hispanics, suburban women and veterans. He commended Sanders’ supporters and said they share a vision for affordable health care, a need to reduce income inequality and to fight climate change. “Sen. Sanders and I may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision,” Biden said. “Sen. Sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all of these issues.” Florida offered the biggest prize for Biden, with 219 pledged delegates. At stake in Illinois were 155 delegates and in Arizona were 67 delegates. Ohio, with 136 delegates, postponed its vote because of concerns about coronavirus. The virus declared a worldwide pandemic wreaked havoc with the primaries in all three states, according to voting advocates. Poll workers failed to show up to work. Election officials closed polling places for lack of staff and to move them away from residential facilities for the elderly. And workers lacked wipes and hand sanitizer to reduce the spread of disease. “This pandemic has impacted every aspect of our life, and every aspect of this campaign,” Biden said. “Tackling this pandemic is a national emergency akin to fighting a war.” But the victories built on Biden’s lead toward meeting the 1,991 delegates needed to clinch the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. Biden had at least 1,121 delegates, compared to 839 for Sanders, according to an AP tabulation. Political experts say the remaining states offer little chance for Sanders to make large enough strides to overtake Biden. For example, the Florida win continued Biden’s successful march across the south, after South Carolina revived his campaign Feb. 29. He swept southern states on March 3 Super Tuesday. Still ahead are Georgia May 19 and Louisiana on June 20. The Democratic primary schedule has a bit of a lull for the next month. Puerto Rico holds a primary March 29. April 4 primaries include Hawaii with 24 delegates, Alaska with 15 and Wyoming’s caucuses with 14. Wisconsin has a primary April 7. And then on April 28, five states will make their choices, including New York with 274 delegates and Pennsylvania with 186 delegates. By winning the Florida and Illinois Republican primaries Tuesday night, President Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican party presidential nominee. He exceeded the 1,276 delegates needed to secure the nomination. “The Republican Party is more unified and energized than ever before and it’s because of President Trump’s leadership and clear record of accomplishment on behalf of all Americans,” Brad Parscale, Trump’s 2020 campaign manager said in a statement. Trump easily won every state that held a contest in the Republican primary. Former Vice President Joe Biden has beaten Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Illinois Democratic primary, according to Associated Press projections from voter surveys. The projected outcome, though not unexpected, will further cement Biden’s place as the clear frontrunner in the race for the Democratic nomination. The former vice president started his day Tuesday with a more than 153-delegate lead over Sanders. Voting in Illinois was set to wrap up at 8 p.m. EDT but was extended by an hour in dozens of Cook County precincts. Polling this month had put Biden ahead in Illinois with a large double-digit margin, and so the outcome in the Prairie State had long been forecast. On the other hand, coronavirus fears and early reports of low turnout in the state had raised questions about the predictive value of recent polling. There are 155 delegates at stake in Illinois, the second-largest delegate haul of the three states in play on Tuesday.  Voters in Florida and Arizona were also picking a Democratic candidate Tuesday in the first series of primary elections since the coronavirus has been thrust to the forefront of American consciousness. Biden posted a tweet Tuesday encouraging voters to cast a ballot curbside or by mail, if possible. Former Vice President Joe Biden has beaten Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in Florida’s Democratic primary, the biggest prize among Tuesday’s primaries with 219 pledged delegates, according to Associated Press projections from voter surveys.  The victory continues Biden’s sweep of southern states in the quest to challenge President Donald Trump in November. Illinois was also voting with 155 delegates and Arizona had 67 delegates at stake. Ohio, with 136 delegates, postponed its vote because of concerns about coronavirus. Biden’s win came as no surprise, after leading an average of statewide polling through Tuesday with 64% to 25% for Sanders, according to the tracking site FiveThirtyEight.com. One key distinction between the candidates in Florida, which is home to about 1.5 million Cuban Americans, was over U.S. policy toward the island nation.  Sanders, a Democratic socialist, has praised the literacy programs of Fidel Castro, the late dictator whose control over Cuba led to an estrangement from the U.S. for 50 years. But Biden criticized Sanders for supposing communists in Cuba and other authoritarian regimes. The Chicago Board of Elections is fighting to extend voting in five precincts by an hour Tuesday night amid low turnout due to the coronavirus outbreak. Reports of numerous polling places without necessary equipment or poll workers popped up during the day, as election officials blamed the state’s governor not postponing the primary in light of the outbreak. Jim Allen, spokesman for the Chicago Board of Election, told reporters the board asked the state last week to either delay the primary or move to a mail-in only race, multiple media outlets reported. The governor\'s office has disputed this ""as a lie."" According to the Chicago Board of Elections, those five precincts “will be open until 8 pm pending court order. All remaining precincts close at 7 pm.” Across the state of Illinois, and the country, efforts to contain the virus has escalated with thousands of schools temporarily closing, and restaurants shuttering to only provide take out or delivery services.  Trump on Monday issued guidelines that called for Americans to avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people. The 2020 Democratic primary broke the city’s record for early voting in a primary, with more than 145,000 people going to the polls early, according to the Chicago Tribune. But, election Day voter turnout in Chicago remained dismal through the night, with the voter turnout at just over 267,000 people of 6 pm.  The Chicago Board of Elections tweeted earlier: “This primary is happening in extraordinary times that we have never seen before. We admire the strength of all Chicagoans that are helping ensure our democracy continues today.” The Ohio Democratic Party sued election officials on Tuesday over their unusual decision to cancel in-person voting in the Buckeye State’s presidential primary because of the coronavirus, the latest legal fight to crop up over the move. Democrats sued Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, arguing he does not have the legal authority to reschedule a make-up election absent action from state lawmakers. Instead of setting a new election unilaterally, the suit seeks an extension of absentee balloting until late April. Democrats, who filed the suit in the Ohio Supreme Court, said the litigation was intended in part to preserve the option of a future election. Without it, they said, they are concerned that they might not get another shot at in-person voting.  ""This primary election must move forward,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. “Yesterday’s actions did not create unchecked authority with the governor or secretary of state to run a new election."" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced that the state would push back its election, originally scheduled for Tuesday, to June 2 because of coronavirus fears. But Democratic officials have urged states that have yet to hold their primaries to avoid changing dates. Ohio is one of several states, along with Louisiana, Kentucky and Maryland, that have postponed voting because of the virus. National party officials have requested that states “use a variety of other critical mechanisms” rather than moving primaries. Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez said Tuesday that it is “critical that states provide clarity and not confusion, which could lead to disenfranchising voters.” CHICAGO -- Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Chicago election officials feuded Tuesday over the state’s decision to push ahead with voting despite health concerns from the coronavirus pandemic. Election Day voter turnout in Chicago was dismal – around 126,000 by 1 p.m. – below even local mayoral elections in the city and one-third the turnout pace of the 2020 primary election. In the separate suburban Cook County, 119,000 had voted by 3 p.m., also vastly below past primary turnouts. Jim Allen, spokesman for the Chicago Board of Election, told reporters the board asked the state last week to either delay the primary or move to a mail-in only race, multiple media outlets reported. That drew a sharply worded tweet from Anne Caprara, Pritzker’s chief of staff: “This is a lie. And frankly, given what we are dealing with in this moment, I’m disgusted that Jim Allen would lie like this,” Caprara said. “We offered them the national guard, young volunteers and assistance with keeping polling places clean.” In another tweet, she added: “The Governor has been trying to balance continuity of government, not disenfranchising people who already voted, avoiding a legal crisis & keeping everyone safe. The Chicago Board of Elections have been worried about scoring cheap political points.” Although Election Day turnout will likely remain low in Chicago, the overall numbers could be lifted by strong early-voting figures. The 2020 Democratic primary broke the city’s record for early voting in a primary, with more than 145,000 people going to the polls early, according to the Chicago Tribune. It eclipsed the 140,000 who voted early in Chicago in the 2016 Democratic Primary. The city also broke a World War II-era record with 118,000 vote-by-mail ballot requests. Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden is the heavy favorite to win the most delegates in Illinois. The last two polls taken of likely Democratic voters in Illinois each found Biden ahead of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders by more than 20 percentage points. The Democratic National Committee is urging states who have yet to hold their primaries to avoid changing primary dates due to the coronavirus pandemic. DNC chairman Tom Perez said in a statement that states should instead  “use a variety of other critical mechanisms that will make voting easier and safer for voters and election officials alike,” instead “of moving primaries to later in the cycle when timing around the virus remains unpredictable.” He noted that states should use a vote-by-mail system or if they can still vote in-person under public health guidelines, then they should expand days and hours of early voting to reduce lines on Election Day.  ""As our country deals with the uncertainty of COVID-19, it is critical that states provide clarity and not confusion, which could lead to disenfranchising voters,” Perez said in the statement. The statement comes less than 24 hours after Ohio postponed their primary election last minute. The state’s primary was supposed to be held Tuesday and a new date has yet to be set. Several other states, including Louisiana, Kentucky and Maryland, have also postponed their primary dates. “What happened in Ohio last night has only bred more chaos and confusion, and the Democratic Party leadership in Ohio is working tirelessly to protect the right to vote,” Perez said in a statement. “Eligible voters deserve certainty, safety, and accessibility.”  “The right to vote is the foundation of our democracy, and we must do everything we can to protect and expand that right instead of bringing our democratic process to a halt,” Perez concluded. In a primary election suddenly consumed by fears about the coronavirus pandemic, seven in ten Florida voters said they trust former Vice President Joe Biden more than Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to handle a crisis, according to an NBC report on the poll. The results were widely consistent across the states voting Tuesday, the first to cast a ballot amid an outbreak of COVID-19 that has disrupted the routines of millions of Americans. More than six in 10 Illinois voters and 63% of Arizona voters said they would trust Biden more than Sanders to handle a crisis. Because of the virus and increasingly stringent requests for social distancing, the National Election Pool did not conduct in-person exit polls for Tuesday\'s primaries, NBC reported. Instead, the outlets conducted a telephone survey of voters before Tuesday\'s vote. After some Florida polling sites opened late Tuesday, Florida election officials defended their decision to press forward with its presidential primaries amid a global coronavirus pandemic. Secretary of State Laurel Lee said one precinct in Broward County opened late but was ""up and running,"" The Tallahassee Democrat reported, and there were ""isolated precincts in Palm Beach County that have had some challenges."" ""All other counties reported on-time opening of all voting locations around the state,"" she said. Lee said voters who did not want to go to polling sites over health concerns could pick up vote-by-mail ballots and turn them in by 7 p.m. EDT. A group of civils rights organizations, including the New Florida Majority, LatinoJustice and Dream Defenders, sued Lee and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in federal court Monday, seeking to extend vote-by-mail deadlines through March 27, to allow people concerned about going to precincts a chance to vote. WASHINGTON – Democratic primary voters in Florida, Illinois and Arizona found some confusion at polling places that moved or closed because of coronavirus, but voting advocates said Tuesday that turnout might still eclipse the 2016 primary. Alex Gulotta, Arizona state director of the advocacy group All Voting Is Local, said concerns about coronavirus prompted officials to close polling places, which confused voters about where to go. In Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, the number of polling places dropped from 240 to 151, but anyone who is registered could vote at any of them. But while in-person voting was running low at about 20% of expectations, more people voted already by mail than in 2016, Gulotta said. “We’ve had enormous turnout by mail,” he said. “Turnout has been very low today, but overall, voting is more than 2016.” Jay Young, executive director of Common Cause Illinois, said problems emerged early with election judges who didn’t show up and polling places closed. Poll workers complained about a lack of wipes or hand sanitizer, he said. “Here in Illinois, it’s been a hectic and trying day,” he said, with in-person turnout running about one-third the rate of previous primaries. Liza McClenaghan, board chair for Common Cause Florida, said a number of poll workers in Palm Beach County didn’t report to work Tuesday. Some had keys to polling places, which prevented them opening, and others had keys to equipment, which prevented using them, she said. The county invited voters to visit one of four election offices, or to mail in ballots. But McClenaghan said elderly voters have been asking where to vote as they discovered closed polling places and were suspicious of having mail-in ballots delivered by strangers. “We’ve had a dog’s breakfast about information for poll closings,” McClenaghan said. “We hope things improve shortly.” Karen Hobert Flynn, president of Common Cause, said the challenges in the primaries will give election officials an opportunity to find remedies such as allowing more mail-in voting by the November election. “Today we’re faced with a challenge unlike anything we’ve seen in our 50 years of advocacy, a global pandemic where all 50 states have now declared a state of emergency,” she said. WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. – Palm Beach County, Florida faced a shortage in poll workers Tuesday morning as Florida held its presidential primary amid the nation’s coronavirus pandemic. Some voters found closed doors when they arrived at their voting sites, The Palm Beach Post reported. Some locations opened late but others remained closed, prompting officials to allow voters pick up vote-by-mail ballots at any of the county’s election offices. Ahead of Election Day, around 800 poll workers notified Palm Beach elected officials they would not work because of concerns about the COVID-19 outbreak, leaving nearly 3,000 workers to cover Palm Beach County’s 454 voting sites. Penny Powell of West Palm Beach told The Post she went to her polling place, Pine Jog Environmental Center, to find it closed. She said a park worker sent her to the Supervisor of Elections\' main office, where she was able to vote. “They’re both close to each other so it wasn’t out of the way,” she said. “So I’m good with it.” She did not know why her location was not open. Former Vice President Joe Biden is heavily favored to defeat Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in Florida’s Democratic presidential primary. But turnout is a major wild card, particularly with the possibility it could disproportionately dissuade senior voters from the polls. Biden performs better among old voters while young voters overwhelmingly back Sanders. At one Palm Beach County location, the King’s Point clubhouse west of Delray Beach, only 32 people had voted as of noon. Poll workers there said they expected a low turnout because of the coronavirus. But at other locations, voters said they waited in line for nearly an hour. As coronavirus precautions, voters are told to space out six feet apart as they wait to vote. WASHINGTON – Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced Tuesday his state would postpone its primary, moving it from April 28 to June 2. The move comes as Arizona, Florida, and Illinois hold their Democratic presidential primary elections Tuesday. Ohio closed its polling places after Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, declared a ""health emergency."" ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at a unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said in a release late Monday.  The virus, which has been named COVID-19, already appears to have depressed turnout in morning voting in Chicago. The Chicago Board of Elections said there was ""extremely low turnout"" in morning voting. From 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. EDT, only 10,000 votes were cast, the Board said, as opposed to 30,000 votes that would be cast in a low turnout election.  Former Vice President Joe Biden currently leads the national delegate count with 898, whereas Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has 745 delegates. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, has two delegates.  Former Vice President Joe Biden is heavily favored to defeat Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders as Arizona Democrats head to the polls for the state’s primary election amid the global pandemic. Maricopa County election officials, in reaction to the coronavirus, closed 80 polling places and made the remaining 151 voting locations ""vote centers,” allowing voters to vote at any location, not just the one in their neighborhood.   Sanders visited Phoenix earlier this month to bolster his campaign. He is counting on the state\'s significant Latino population to provide a boost for him, but recent polling suggests he remains well behind here. --Ronald J. Hansen and Yvonne Wingett Sanchez, Arizona Republic."',

        ArticleContent: '"Joe Biden swept all three primaries on Tuesday night in Arizona, Florida and Illinois, CBS News projects. The contests took place amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis that led Ohio officials to postpone their primary, which had also been scheduled for Tuesday. In remarks after his early win in Florida, Biden, speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, said his campaign appeared to have had a ""very good night,"" but he also spoke about the coronavirus crisis. He told Americans that ""it\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy."" Bernie Sanders gave remarks via livestream earlier in the night. He focused mainly on the coronavirus crisis and highlighted unity. Tuesday\'s lopsided results will expand the divide in delegates between Biden and Sanders. It\'s unclear when the next primary contests will be held. Georgia, which had been set to vote on March 24, has postponed its primary, as did Louisiana, which was scheduled to go to the polls on April 4. As of 12 a.m. ET on Wednesday, Biden had increased his lead to 291 delegates. Biden now has 1,093 delegates to Sanders\' 802. To get the nomination, the Democratic candidate will need 1,991 delegates. According to CBS News primary polling in Arizona, the most important candidate quality for voters was being able to unite the country. Of those voters, 65% said they voted for Biden, while just 16% went for Sanders. The poll was mostly of voters who already voted by mail and includes those who said they were likely to show up at polls today. Like Florida and Illinois voters, 69% of Arizona voters saw Biden as the candidate with the best chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to 26% who believed the same of Sanders. Biden was also seen as the candidate trusted more to handle a major crisis. Biden led among white voters by 51% to 32%. Hispanic voters were more evenly divided: Biden 45% to Sanders 44%. CBS News projects the former vice president wins the Arizona primary, finalizing Biden\'s sweep of the three states that voted. Sixty-seven pledged delegates are up for grabs in Arizona. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose cheered the decision to postpone the state\'s primary election until June 2, saying it ""saved Ohio lives."" ""By preventing Ohioans from going to polling locations, we averted a situation which would have gone against the most recent scientific evidence available and could have dangerously advanced the spread of coronavirus across Ohio,"" the two said in a joining statement. ""It is abundantly clear that it would have been impossible to carry out a fair, accessible, and safe election today."" DeWine and LaRose stressed that Ohio voters should have a ""significant"" amount of time to cast mail-in absentee ballots and also vote in-person. Less than 12 hours before the polls were set to open in Ohio, DeWine announced that Dr. Amy Acton, director of the Ohio Department of Health, would be issuing an order to close polls ""to avoid the imminent threat with the high probability of widespread exposure to COVID-19."" As of 11 p.m. ET, Biden is leading in every county in Florida. Although Hillary Clinton won the primary in 2016, Sanders won nine counties in the northern part of the state in that contest. The Arizona secretary of state has revealed that personal information related to some protected voters was erroneously included in reports generated from the state\'s voter registration database. Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said in a statement that the error was not the result of a security breach or vulnerability. Hobbs said her office was notified from a county official that an early ballot report they compiled included ""protected voters,"" or those whose information is protected due to their jobs or if they were victims of certain crimes. Seventy-eight names were mistakenly included in the reports, the secretary of state\'s office said, and the office has asked county officials to contact those who were directly impacted. The early ballot reports are produced using data from the state\'s voter registration database, and the reports are provided by counties to political parties during elections. Hobb\'s office said the process for producing reports from the voter registration database has also been updated to prevent future errors. Biden celebrated his early wins in Illinois and Florida with a solemn address to supporters calling for the country to come together in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, while also thanking Bernie Sanders and his supporters for the ""remarkable passion"" they have brought to the Democratic race. Speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, with a backdrop of black cloth and flanked by two American flags, Biden remarked that his campaign ""has had a very good night"" and is moving closer to securing the Democratic presidential nomination. He also thanked election officials and poll workers in the three states with in-person voting for ensuring people could cast their ballots while also remaining safe. ""It\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy,"" he said. Biden said that his campaign is building a broad coalition that includes support from African-Americans, the Latino community, labor, firefighters, teachers, suburban women and others. ""We\'re doing it with a common vision,"" he said, adding that he and Sanders share that vision. The former vice president also thanked Sanders and his supporters for bringing ""remarkable passion and tenacity"" to issues like healthcare, income inequality and climate change, and delivered a message directly to young Sanders supporters. ""To young votes who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you, I know what\'s at stake. I know what we have to do,"" he said. ""Our goal as a campaign and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party and to unify the nation."" Biden also praised Americans for altering their lives as public health officials rush to limit the spread of the coronavirus, saying that Americans are ""ordinary people doing extraordinary things when the need arises and today we are moving quickly to adapt our routines to meet this challenge."" ""It\'s in moments like these we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans,"" Biden said. ""The coronavirus doesn\'t care if you\'re a Democrat or Republican. It will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender or your zip code. It will touch people in positions of power as well as the most vulnerable people in our society. We\'re all in this together."" A large number of likely voters in Illinois, 87%, said they were concerned about coronavirus, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to the primary. Biden received the support of likely voters concerned about the coronavirus by about 2-to-1. Similar percentages of likely voters are worried about the direction of the nation\'s economy in 2021, and Biden received their support by a similar margin. Sixty-four percent of likely voters in the Illinois primary picked Biden over Sanders as the person they would trust more to handle a major crisis. Likely primary voters in Illinois said beating President Trump was more important to them than having a candidate who agreed with them on the issues, and 69% said Biden would have the better chance to defeat the incumbent president in November. Polling shows Biden with a commanding lead among black likely voters – getting 70% of those polled – but he also received a majority vote of white likely voters as well, securing the support of both whites with and without college degrees. He received the support of over half of men and nearly two-thirds of women. The generational divide seen throughout this election cycle was also apparent in Illinois, with Sanders taking the vast majority of likely voters under 45, and Biden getting the strong support among older voters. But older likely voters significantly outnumbered their younger counterparts: more than six in ten likely voters were over the age of 45. And while Sanders maintains strong support of likely voters who say they are very liberal – getting nearly two-thirds support among this group – they made up just over a quarter of those polled. Biden garnered strong support among likely voters who said they were ""somewhat liberal"", and did particularly well among moderates. CBS News estimates Illinois leans toward Biden. At the moment, Chicago looks to be very close between Biden and Sanders, but many more votes are expected to be counted. The current delegate allocation in Illinois has Biden with 33 delegates and Sanders with 21. There are 155 total delegates at stake in Illinois. Following wins in the Republican primaries in Illinois and Florida, President Trump has secured the delegates needed to win the Republican presidential nomination, CBS News projects. President Trump has clinched the Republican nomination.https://t.co/E3KhCZjESV pic.twitter.com/YNT7WliBd0 — CBS News (@CBSNews) March 18, 2020 Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel offered congratulations to Mr. Trump for ""officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for president."" Congratulations to Donald J. Trump on officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for President! His home state of Florida just delivered him the delegates he needed. Our party is united, our grassroots movement is fired up, and we are ready for FOUR MORE YEARS! pic.twitter.com/B4X9IaQp7f — Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) March 18, 2020 Mr. Trump had several early challengers for the Republican nomination, though most dropped out of the race. Only former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld remains in the race. Most likely voters in Florida said electability was a priority for them going into the primary, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to March 17. Seventy-three percent of likely voters also think Biden would have a good chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to just 21% who picked Sanders. Voters over age 45 were more likely to say they support Biden. Those who want the next president to return to Obama policies instead of more liberal policies said they would vote for Biden. Nearly half of Florida likely voters said Sanders\' issue positions were too liberal, but most said Biden\'s issue positions were about right. Florida likely voters said they trusted Biden over Sanders by a wide margin — 59% to 37% — to handle Social Security. anders addressed supporters in a livestreamed speech after polls closed in most of Florida and called for the country to come together as local, state and federal officials respond to the coronavirus. ""I think the main point to be made tonight is that in this moment of crisis, it is imperative that we stand together, understand that right now throughout this country, there are so many of our people wondering what\'s going to happen to me tomorrow?"" Sanders said. He added that ""this is a moment that we have got to be working together."" Sanders laid out a series of proposals he said he plans to present to Democratic leadership and said an adequate response will require an ""unprecedented"" amount of money."" Sanders estimated the price tag will top $2 trillion. The plans put forth by Sanders to bolster the response to the coronavirus include allowing Medicare to cover all medical bills during the public health crisis; increasing test kits for the coronavirus and the speed at which tests are processed; activating the National Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other military resources to help expand healthcare capacity; and using emergency authority to scale up production in the U.S. of critical supplies and protective equipment. Sanders also suggested a number of measures to mitigate the economic impacts for American workers and their families, including providing a $2,000 monthly cash payment to every household for the duration of the crisis, expanding Meals on Wheels and food stamps and placing a moratorium on evictions, foreclosures and utility shutoffs. ""We must make certain that the government is getting this money into the hands of working families and the most vulnerable as quickly as possible,"" he said. Sanders said the economic crisis should not be ""another money-making opportunity"" for large corporations and Wall Street. ""We\'ve got some major crisis, but I have the strong belief that if we work together, if we do not turn to fear and panic, but if we understand that the way we solve this is by going forward as one people, remembering those who are hurting tonight and will be hurting in the future,"" he said. ""This is the richest country in the history world. This is a country with unbelievable energy, with unbelievable talent, with incredible resources. We can do it. We can address this crisis, we can minimize the pain and let us do just that."" CBS News projects Biden will win Florida, the biggest prize in Tuesday\'s primaries with 219 pledged delegates. Florida has a large Hispanic population, and Biden has previously struggled to gain support from Hispanic voters in states which have already held primaries, like Nevada. The delegate allocation at poll closing in Florida was 100 delegates for Biden, and 27 for Sanders, according to CBS News\' analysis. All polls are now closed in Florida and in Illinois, after an election day marked by fears about the spread of the coronavirus. Polls close in Arizona at 10 p.m. ET. The Ohio primary has been pushed back until June 2. Sanders will livestream remarks about the coronavirus crisis at 7:15 p.m., shortly after polls close in Florida. The speech will address how the ""response to the outbreak should put working families and the most vulnerable first,"" according to a press release from the campaign. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democrats said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Biden and Sanders have made remarks outlining their plans to respond to the crisis. The Florida Democratic Party said the number of Democrats who have voted early in person and by mail has exceeded turnout in the primaries in 2016. According to the state party, 141,560 more Democrats voted by mail this year than they did in the last presidential primary. Additionally, 74,031 more Democrats voted early in person this year than in 2016. The Florida Democratic Party also said it enrolled nearly 500,000 new Democrats into vote-by-mail in 2018. The party said that the coronavirus pandemic, which has impacted voting in states holding their contests today, demonstrates the need for the government to revamp voting methods. As the country deals with a health care crisis, the issue of health care remains on voters\' minds. In Arizona, Florida, and Illinois, voters picked health care as the issue that would be most important in determining their vote, according to CBS News primary polls. The second most important issue among voters in each of the three states was income inequality, followed by climate change and race relations. Likely Democratic voters in Illinois said they are also worried about the economy, primary polls show. More than eight in 10 are least somewhat concerned about the national economy over the next year. In the three states where voters will head to the polls Tuesday, most said they prefer the Democratic nominee be someone who can beat Trump — at least six in 10 in each state— over someone they agree with on major issues, according to CBS News primary polls. As has been the case throughout this campaign, there are high levels of dissatisfaction toward the Trump administration among the Democratic primary electorate. Large majorities of likely voters in Florida and Illinois and those who voted by mail in Arizona said they feel angry about the Trump administration. Among likely Democratic voters in Illinois, more Sanders supporters said they would be unhappy about Biden being the nominee than Biden supporters would be if Sanders became the nominee, according to primary polls. Fifty-four percent of Sanders supporters would be dissatisfied or upset if Biden won the nomination, compared to 37% of Biden backers who would feel that way if Sanders became the nominee. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democratic voters said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Among those polled in Florida, 71% said they trusted Biden more, compared to 23% who said Sanders is the candidate they trust to handle a major crisis. In Illinois, 64% of Democratic voters selected Biden while 31% said Sanders is more trusted, and in Arizona, 63% said they trust Biden more to handle a major crisis compared to 31%, who pointed to Sanders. The Democratic National Committee is calling on states that haven\'t yet held their primaries to vote by mail, as coronavirus threatens future primaries. ""The simplest tool is vote by mail, which is already in use in a number of states and should be made available to all registered voters. States using vote by mail should proactively mail ballots to registered voters, where feasible, and should count all ballots as long as they are postmarked by the date of the primary,"" DNC chair Tom Perez said in a statement on Wednesday. Where in-person voting can take place in accordance with health guidelines, states should expand the days and hours of early voting to cut down on lines, Perez added. According to CBS News primary polls, nearly all likely voters in Illinois expressed at least some concern about the effects of the coronavirus, including more than half who said they are very concerned about it. Most likely voters of all ages in Illinois said they are concerned, but older voters are particularly so: 62% of voters ages 45 and over say they are very concerned, compared to 38% of younger voters. Women (59%) were also more likely than men (46%) to be very concerned. Some voters, meanwhile, said the coronavirus could change their decision to vote. In Florida, among those who said they would definitely vote and planned to do so in person on Election Day, 15% said it was very or somewhat likely that they could change their decision to vote. In Illinois, that figure was 9%, according to primary polls. The Biden campaign is optimistic it will walk away from Tuesday\'s primaries with a wider delegate lead than it had going into the contests despite the challenges to voter turnout raised because of the coronavirus. ""It would take a drastic, historically-incomparable swing for Senator Sanders to win more delegates than Biden today or to close the delegate differential,"" the campaign said in a memo released Tuesday. Heading into the four primaries held on Tuesday, Biden led Sanders by more than 100 delegates. The former vice president\'s campaign also noted that while fewer people may head to the polls on Election Day because of the coronavirus, it expects overall turnout to match that of past elections. ""While voter turnout on Election Day itself may be lower due to COVID-19 concerns, we believe that, with early vote and vote by mail, overall turnout will be roughly on pace for 2016 in Arizona and Florida and roughly on pace for 2018 in Illinois, and that voter turnout in all three states will reflect the population at large,"" the campaign said in the memo. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, on Tuesday defended the decision to keep the polls open despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. ""There are people out there today who want to say, \'Oh, it\'s a crisis, bend the rules and overstep your authority,\'"" Pritzker said. ""Let me tell you this, It is exactly in times like these, when the constitutional boundaries of our democracy should be respected above all else. And if people want to criticize me for that, well, go ahead. I\'ll wear it like a badge of honor."" Earlier Tuesday, Chicago Board of Elections spokesman Jim Allen said he urged Pritzker to prohibit voting in person and go fully vote-by-mail. Allen later apologized for the remarks. The Chicago Board of Elections said they said they\'ve had to move in total 200 precincts, with some locations in the city dropping out as soon as this morning (these cases were immediately moved to a new location). In Chicago, 126,499 votes have been cast through 2 p.m. ET, with a surge after the first two hours. Biden tweeted a reminder about polls being open in Arizona, Florida and Illinois. ""I encourage folks to vote by mail or curbside vote if you can,"" Biden wrote. ""If you vote in person, please wash your hands, don\'t touch your face, and stay 6\' from others in line."" Maryland Governor Larry Hogan announced at a press conference on Tuesday morning that the state will move its primary from April 28 until June 2. The state Board of Elections issued a statement shortly after that ""fully supports"" Hogan\'s decision. The decision follows similar action in Georgia, Kentucky and Louisiana. In a last-minute move on Monday, Ohio postponed its primary. The Ohio State Supreme Court denied a challenge to Ohio\'s primary delay filed by Wood County judicial candidate Corey Speweik, who was fighting the state of Ohio\'s decision to shut down Tuesday\'s primary and postpone voting until June over concern about the spread of the coronavirus. The process leading up to the delay was chaotic. With less than 12 hours to go before polls were scheduled to open in Ohio for the state\'s presidential primary election, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, announced polls would remain closed Tuesday amid concerns over the coronavirus. The decision came just hours after a Franklin County judge denied a request backed by the governor and secretary of state to delay the election. The Ohio Democratic Party said in a statement Tuesday that although voting did not seem feasible, it hoped the primary would be rescheduled for earlier than June 2. ""Given the chaos, confusion and mixed messages of the past 24 hours, it\'s clearly impossible for in-person voting to move forward today in Ohio,"" the party said in a statement. ""The Ohio Democratic Party strongly supports concluding the primary election earlier than June 2. Extending for that long is highly problematic for any number for reasons, and it is not at all clear that in-person voting will be possible on that date anyway,"" the statement continued. At a news conference Monday, in response to a question about the possible impact of the coronavirus outbreak, President Trump said delaying elections would be ""not a very good thing."" ""I\'d leave that up to the states,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Postponing elections is not a very good thing … I think postponing is unnecessary."" A poll by Monmouth University released on Monday showed Biden with a double-digit advantage over Sanders in Arizona. Among voters likely to participate in the primary, Biden was supported by 51% to Sanders\' 31%. Sanders leads among Latino voters by seven points, and among voters under 50 years old by wide margins. But this is more than offset by Biden\'s strong advantage among larger voter blocs, including white voters and those aged 50 and over. In head-to-head matchups with the president, Biden had a small edge Mr. Trump, but the president was virtually tied with Sanders. Although Arizona has long been a solid red state, it could be a battleground this November. Mr. Trump only won the state by 4 points against Hillary Clinton in 2016. In the Senate race, Democrat Mark Kelly had a 6-point edge in the poll over incumbent Martha McSally. "',
        AnswerContent: '"Check back for updates as polls close in three states amid the coronavirus pandemic. Former Vice President Joe Biden swept all three states voting Tuesday in a series of primaries that were heavily influenced by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. His last win of the night came in Arizona, where the Associated Press projected a victory through voter surveys. Biden secured early projected wins in Florida and Illinois, where he was long heavily favored to win, and he captured the state of Arizona shortly after polls there closed at 10 p.m. EDT. In all, more than 440 delegates were up for grabs in the latest round of voting, and Biden’s projected victories handed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders a formidable challenge to catch up. It was the first series of primaries to take place amid the national state of emergency President Donald Trump declared over the coronavirus pandemic, a circumstance that had the potential to upend the candidates’ messages as well as the technical process of running a primary election. The Democratic primary schedule has a bit of a lull for the next month. Puerto Rico holds a primary March 29. April 4 primaries include Hawaii with 24 delegates, Alaska with 15 and Wyoming’s caucuses with 14. Wisconsin has a primary April 7. And then on April 28, five states will make their choices, including New York with 274 delegates and Pennsylvania with 186 delegates. Ohioans were set to cast their ballots on Tuesday but state officials there announced they would postpone the election until sometime after the outbreak had passed. “This pandemic has impacted every aspect of our lives, and every aspect of this campaign,” Biden said in a video streamed from his home in Delaware, where he eschewed the traditional rally to deliver his election night remarks. “It’s at moments like these that we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans.” Both candidates avoided attacks on each other, or even discussing the latest contours of the race.    “In this moment of crisis it is imperative that we stand together,” Sanders said in his own video message. “This is a moment that we’ve got to be working together.” Heading into the election, Biden had a better than 153-delegate lead over Sanders.    Trump, who never faced a significant challenge, also swept the primaries Tuesday and exceeded the 1,276 delegates needed to become the GOP’s presumptive nominee. As Arizona’s polls closed Tuesday with uncertain results, former Vice President Joe Biden looked to add to his Democratic primary wins in Florida and Illinois against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, according to Associated Press projections from voter surveys. Biden’s victories came on the same night President Donald Trump locked up the Republican nomination for his re-election. Biden said from his home in Wilmington, Del., that the victories demonstrated a broad coalition to beat Trump, including blacks, Hispanics, suburban women and veterans. He commended Sanders’ supporters and said they share a vision for affordable health care, a need to reduce income inequality and to fight climate change. “Sen. Sanders and I may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision,” Biden said. “Sen. Sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all of these issues.” Florida offered the biggest prize for Biden, with 219 pledged delegates. At stake in Illinois were 155 delegates and in Arizona were 67 delegates. Ohio, with 136 delegates, postponed its vote because of concerns about coronavirus. The virus declared a worldwide pandemic wreaked havoc with the primaries in all three states, according to voting advocates. Poll workers failed to show up to work. Election officials closed polling places for lack of staff and to move them away from residential facilities for the elderly. And workers lacked wipes and hand sanitizer to reduce the spread of disease. “This pandemic has impacted every aspect of our life, and every aspect of this campaign,” Biden said. “Tackling this pandemic is a national emergency akin to fighting a war.” But the victories built on Biden’s lead toward meeting the 1,991 delegates needed to clinch the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. Biden had at least 1,121 delegates, compared to 839 for Sanders, according to an AP tabulation. Political experts say the remaining states offer little chance for Sanders to make large enough strides to overtake Biden. For example, the Florida win continued Biden’s successful march across the south, after South Carolina revived his campaign Feb. 29. He swept southern states on March 3 Super Tuesday. Still ahead are Georgia May 19 and Louisiana on June 20. The Democratic primary schedule has a bit of a lull for the next month. Puerto Rico holds a primary March 29. April 4 primaries include Hawaii with 24 delegates, Alaska with 15 and Wyoming’s caucuses with 14. Wisconsin has a primary April 7. And then on April 28, five states will make their choices, including New York with 274 delegates and Pennsylvania with 186 delegates. By winning the Florida and Illinois Republican primaries Tuesday night, President Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican party presidential nominee. He exceeded the 1,276 delegates needed to secure the nomination. “The Republican Party is more unified and energized than ever before and it’s because of President Trump’s leadership and clear record of accomplishment on behalf of all Americans,” Brad Parscale, Trump’s 2020 campaign manager said in a statement. Trump easily won every state that held a contest in the Republican primary. Former Vice President Joe Biden has beaten Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Illinois Democratic primary, according to Associated Press projections from voter surveys. The projected outcome, though not unexpected, will further cement Biden’s place as the clear frontrunner in the race for the Democratic nomination. The former vice president started his day Tuesday with a more than 153-delegate lead over Sanders. Voting in Illinois was set to wrap up at 8 p.m. EDT but was extended by an hour in dozens of Cook County precincts. Polling this month had put Biden ahead in Illinois with a large double-digit margin, and so the outcome in the Prairie State had long been forecast. On the other hand, coronavirus fears and early reports of low turnout in the state had raised questions about the predictive value of recent polling. There are 155 delegates at stake in Illinois, the second-largest delegate haul of the three states in play on Tuesday.  Voters in Florida and Arizona were also picking a Democratic candidate Tuesday in the first series of primary elections since the coronavirus has been thrust to the forefront of American consciousness. Biden posted a tweet Tuesday encouraging voters to cast a ballot curbside or by mail, if possible. Former Vice President Joe Biden has beaten Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in Florida’s Democratic primary, the biggest prize among Tuesday’s primaries with 219 pledged delegates, according to Associated Press projections from voter surveys.  The victory continues Biden’s sweep of southern states in the quest to challenge President Donald Trump in November. Illinois was also voting with 155 delegates and Arizona had 67 delegates at stake. Ohio, with 136 delegates, postponed its vote because of concerns about coronavirus. Biden’s win came as no surprise, after leading an average of statewide polling through Tuesday with 64% to 25% for Sanders, according to the tracking site FiveThirtyEight.com. One key distinction between the candidates in Florida, which is home to about 1.5 million Cuban Americans, was over U.S. policy toward the island nation.  Sanders, a Democratic socialist, has praised the literacy programs of Fidel Castro, the late dictator whose control over Cuba led to an estrangement from the U.S. for 50 years. But Biden criticized Sanders for supposing communists in Cuba and other authoritarian regimes. The Chicago Board of Elections is fighting to extend voting in five precincts by an hour Tuesday night amid low turnout due to the coronavirus outbreak. Reports of numerous polling places without necessary equipment or poll workers popped up during the day, as election officials blamed the state’s governor not postponing the primary in light of the outbreak. Jim Allen, spokesman for the Chicago Board of Election, told reporters the board asked the state last week to either delay the primary or move to a mail-in only race, multiple media outlets reported. The governor\'s office has disputed this ""as a lie."" According to the Chicago Board of Elections, those five precincts “will be open until 8 pm pending court order. All remaining precincts close at 7 pm.” Across the state of Illinois, and the country, efforts to contain the virus has escalated with thousands of schools temporarily closing, and restaurants shuttering to only provide take out or delivery services.  Trump on Monday issued guidelines that called for Americans to avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people. The 2020 Democratic primary broke the city’s record for early voting in a primary, with more than 145,000 people going to the polls early, according to the Chicago Tribune. But, election Day voter turnout in Chicago remained dismal through the night, with the voter turnout at just over 267,000 people of 6 pm.  The Chicago Board of Elections tweeted earlier: “This primary is happening in extraordinary times that we have never seen before. We admire the strength of all Chicagoans that are helping ensure our democracy continues today.” The Ohio Democratic Party sued election officials on Tuesday over their unusual decision to cancel in-person voting in the Buckeye State’s presidential primary because of the coronavirus, the latest legal fight to crop up over the move. Democrats sued Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, arguing he does not have the legal authority to reschedule a make-up election absent action from state lawmakers. Instead of setting a new election unilaterally, the suit seeks an extension of absentee balloting until late April. Democrats, who filed the suit in the Ohio Supreme Court, said the litigation was intended in part to preserve the option of a future election. Without it, they said, they are concerned that they might not get another shot at in-person voting.  ""This primary election must move forward,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. “Yesterday’s actions did not create unchecked authority with the governor or secretary of state to run a new election."" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced that the state would push back its election, originally scheduled for Tuesday, to June 2 because of coronavirus fears. But Democratic officials have urged states that have yet to hold their primaries to avoid changing dates. Ohio is one of several states, along with Louisiana, Kentucky and Maryland, that have postponed voting because of the virus. National party officials have requested that states “use a variety of other critical mechanisms” rather than moving primaries. Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez said Tuesday that it is “critical that states provide clarity and not confusion, which could lead to disenfranchising voters.” CHICAGO -- Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Chicago election officials feuded Tuesday over the state’s decision to push ahead with voting despite health concerns from the coronavirus pandemic. Election Day voter turnout in Chicago was dismal – around 126,000 by 1 p.m. – below even local mayoral elections in the city and one-third the turnout pace of the 2020 primary election. In the separate suburban Cook County, 119,000 had voted by 3 p.m., also vastly below past primary turnouts. Jim Allen, spokesman for the Chicago Board of Election, told reporters the board asked the state last week to either delay the primary or move to a mail-in only race, multiple media outlets reported. That drew a sharply worded tweet from Anne Caprara, Pritzker’s chief of staff: “This is a lie. And frankly, given what we are dealing with in this moment, I’m disgusted that Jim Allen would lie like this,” Caprara said. “We offered them the national guard, young volunteers and assistance with keeping polling places clean.” In another tweet, she added: “The Governor has been trying to balance continuity of government, not disenfranchising people who already voted, avoiding a legal crisis & keeping everyone safe. The Chicago Board of Elections have been worried about scoring cheap political points.” Although Election Day turnout will likely remain low in Chicago, the overall numbers could be lifted by strong early-voting figures. The 2020 Democratic primary broke the city’s record for early voting in a primary, with more than 145,000 people going to the polls early, according to the Chicago Tribune. It eclipsed the 140,000 who voted early in Chicago in the 2016 Democratic Primary. The city also broke a World War II-era record with 118,000 vote-by-mail ballot requests. Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden is the heavy favorite to win the most delegates in Illinois. The last two polls taken of likely Democratic voters in Illinois each found Biden ahead of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders by more than 20 percentage points. The Democratic National Committee is urging states who have yet to hold their primaries to avoid changing primary dates due to the coronavirus pandemic. DNC chairman Tom Perez said in a statement that states should instead  “use a variety of other critical mechanisms that will make voting easier and safer for voters and election officials alike,” instead “of moving primaries to later in the cycle when timing around the virus remains unpredictable.” He noted that states should use a vote-by-mail system or if they can still vote in-person under public health guidelines, then they should expand days and hours of early voting to reduce lines on Election Day.  ""As our country deals with the uncertainty of COVID-19, it is critical that states provide clarity and not confusion, which could lead to disenfranchising voters,” Perez said in the statement. The statement comes less than 24 hours after Ohio postponed their primary election last minute. The state’s primary was supposed to be held Tuesday and a new date has yet to be set. Several other states, including Louisiana, Kentucky and Maryland, have also postponed their primary dates. “What happened in Ohio last night has only bred more chaos and confusion, and the Democratic Party leadership in Ohio is working tirelessly to protect the right to vote,” Perez said in a statement. “Eligible voters deserve certainty, safety, and accessibility.”  “The right to vote is the foundation of our democracy, and we must do everything we can to protect and expand that right instead of bringing our democratic process to a halt,” Perez concluded. In a primary election suddenly consumed by fears about the coronavirus pandemic, seven in ten Florida voters said they trust former Vice President Joe Biden more than Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to handle a crisis, according to an NBC report on the poll. The results were widely consistent across the states voting Tuesday, the first to cast a ballot amid an outbreak of COVID-19 that has disrupted the routines of millions of Americans. More than six in 10 Illinois voters and 63% of Arizona voters said they would trust Biden more than Sanders to handle a crisis. Because of the virus and increasingly stringent requests for social distancing, the National Election Pool did not conduct in-person exit polls for Tuesday\'s primaries, NBC reported. Instead, the outlets conducted a telephone survey of voters before Tuesday\'s vote. After some Florida polling sites opened late Tuesday, Florida election officials defended their decision to press forward with its presidential primaries amid a global coronavirus pandemic. Secretary of State Laurel Lee said one precinct in Broward County opened late but was ""up and running,"" The Tallahassee Democrat reported, and there were ""isolated precincts in Palm Beach County that have had some challenges."" ""All other counties reported on-time opening of all voting locations around the state,"" she said. Lee said voters who did not want to go to polling sites over health concerns could pick up vote-by-mail ballots and turn them in by 7 p.m. EDT. A group of civils rights organizations, including the New Florida Majority, LatinoJustice and Dream Defenders, sued Lee and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in federal court Monday, seeking to extend vote-by-mail deadlines through March 27, to allow people concerned about going to precincts a chance to vote. WASHINGTON – Democratic primary voters in Florida, Illinois and Arizona found some confusion at polling places that moved or closed because of coronavirus, but voting advocates said Tuesday that turnout might still eclipse the 2016 primary. Alex Gulotta, Arizona state director of the advocacy group All Voting Is Local, said concerns about coronavirus prompted officials to close polling places, which confused voters about where to go. In Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, the number of polling places dropped from 240 to 151, but anyone who is registered could vote at any of them. But while in-person voting was running low at about 20% of expectations, more people voted already by mail than in 2016, Gulotta said. “We’ve had enormous turnout by mail,” he said. “Turnout has been very low today, but overall, voting is more than 2016.” Jay Young, executive director of Common Cause Illinois, said problems emerged early with election judges who didn’t show up and polling places closed. Poll workers complained about a lack of wipes or hand sanitizer, he said. “Here in Illinois, it’s been a hectic and trying day,” he said, with in-person turnout running about one-third the rate of previous primaries. Liza McClenaghan, board chair for Common Cause Florida, said a number of poll workers in Palm Beach County didn’t report to work Tuesday. Some had keys to polling places, which prevented them opening, and others had keys to equipment, which prevented using them, she said. The county invited voters to visit one of four election offices, or to mail in ballots. But McClenaghan said elderly voters have been asking where to vote as they discovered closed polling places and were suspicious of having mail-in ballots delivered by strangers. “We’ve had a dog’s breakfast about information for poll closings,” McClenaghan said. “We hope things improve shortly.” Karen Hobert Flynn, president of Common Cause, said the challenges in the primaries will give election officials an opportunity to find remedies such as allowing more mail-in voting by the November election. “Today we’re faced with a challenge unlike anything we’ve seen in our 50 years of advocacy, a global pandemic where all 50 states have now declared a state of emergency,” she said. WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. – Palm Beach County, Florida faced a shortage in poll workers Tuesday morning as Florida held its presidential primary amid the nation’s coronavirus pandemic. Some voters found closed doors when they arrived at their voting sites, The Palm Beach Post reported. Some locations opened late but others remained closed, prompting officials to allow voters pick up vote-by-mail ballots at any of the county’s election offices. Ahead of Election Day, around 800 poll workers notified Palm Beach elected officials they would not work because of concerns about the COVID-19 outbreak, leaving nearly 3,000 workers to cover Palm Beach County’s 454 voting sites. Penny Powell of West Palm Beach told The Post she went to her polling place, Pine Jog Environmental Center, to find it closed. She said a park worker sent her to the Supervisor of Elections\' main office, where she was able to vote. “They’re both close to each other so it wasn’t out of the way,” she said. “So I’m good with it.” She did not know why her location was not open. Former Vice President Joe Biden is heavily favored to defeat Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in Florida’s Democratic presidential primary. But turnout is a major wild card, particularly with the possibility it could disproportionately dissuade senior voters from the polls. Biden performs better among old voters while young voters overwhelmingly back Sanders. At one Palm Beach County location, the King’s Point clubhouse west of Delray Beach, only 32 people had voted as of noon. Poll workers there said they expected a low turnout because of the coronavirus. But at other locations, voters said they waited in line for nearly an hour. As coronavirus precautions, voters are told to space out six feet apart as they wait to vote. WASHINGTON – Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced Tuesday his state would postpone its primary, moving it from April 28 to June 2. The move comes as Arizona, Florida, and Illinois hold their Democratic presidential primary elections Tuesday. Ohio closed its polling places after Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, declared a ""health emergency."" ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at a unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said in a release late Monday.  The virus, which has been named COVID-19, already appears to have depressed turnout in morning voting in Chicago. The Chicago Board of Elections said there was ""extremely low turnout"" in morning voting. From 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. EDT, only 10,000 votes were cast, the Board said, as opposed to 30,000 votes that would be cast in a low turnout election.  Former Vice President Joe Biden currently leads the national delegate count with 898, whereas Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has 745 delegates. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, has two delegates.  Former Vice President Joe Biden is heavily favored to defeat Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders as Arizona Democrats head to the polls for the state’s primary election amid the global pandemic. Maricopa County election officials, in reaction to the coronavirus, closed 80 polling places and made the remaining 151 voting locations ""vote centers,” allowing voters to vote at any location, not just the one in their neighborhood.   Sanders visited Phoenix earlier this month to bolster his campaign. He is counting on the state\'s significant Latino population to provide a boost for him, but recent polling suggests he remains well behind here. --Ronald J. Hansen and Yvonne Wingett Sanchez, Arizona Republic."',

        ArticleContent: '"Joe Biden swept all three primaries on Tuesday night in Arizona, Florida and Illinois, CBS News projects. The contests took place amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis that led Ohio officials to postpone their primary, which had also been scheduled for Tuesday. In remarks after his early win in Florida, Biden, speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, said his campaign appeared to have had a ""very good night,"" but he also spoke about the coronavirus crisis. He told Americans that ""it\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy."" Bernie Sanders gave remarks via livestream earlier in the night. He focused mainly on the coronavirus crisis and highlighted unity. Tuesday\'s lopsided results will expand the divide in delegates between Biden and Sanders. It\'s unclear when the next primary contests will be held. Georgia, which had been set to vote on March 24, has postponed its primary, as did Louisiana, which was scheduled to go to the polls on April 4. As of 12 a.m. ET on Wednesday, Biden had increased his lead to 291 delegates. Biden now has 1,093 delegates to Sanders\' 802. To get the nomination, the Democratic candidate will need 1,991 delegates. According to CBS News primary polling in Arizona, the most important candidate quality for voters was being able to unite the country. Of those voters, 65% said they voted for Biden, while just 16% went for Sanders. The poll was mostly of voters who already voted by mail and includes those who said they were likely to show up at polls today. Like Florida and Illinois voters, 69% of Arizona voters saw Biden as the candidate with the best chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to 26% who believed the same of Sanders. Biden was also seen as the candidate trusted more to handle a major crisis. Biden led among white voters by 51% to 32%. Hispanic voters were more evenly divided: Biden 45% to Sanders 44%. CBS News projects the former vice president wins the Arizona primary, finalizing Biden\'s sweep of the three states that voted. Sixty-seven pledged delegates are up for grabs in Arizona. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose cheered the decision to postpone the state\'s primary election until June 2, saying it ""saved Ohio lives."" ""By preventing Ohioans from going to polling locations, we averted a situation which would have gone against the most recent scientific evidence available and could have dangerously advanced the spread of coronavirus across Ohio,"" the two said in a joining statement. ""It is abundantly clear that it would have been impossible to carry out a fair, accessible, and safe election today."" DeWine and LaRose stressed that Ohio voters should have a ""significant"" amount of time to cast mail-in absentee ballots and also vote in-person. Less than 12 hours before the polls were set to open in Ohio, DeWine announced that Dr. Amy Acton, director of the Ohio Department of Health, would be issuing an order to close polls ""to avoid the imminent threat with the high probability of widespread exposure to COVID-19."" As of 11 p.m. ET, Biden is leading in every county in Florida. Although Hillary Clinton won the primary in 2016, Sanders won nine counties in the northern part of the state in that contest. The Arizona secretary of state has revealed that personal information related to some protected voters was erroneously included in reports generated from the state\'s voter registration database. Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said in a statement that the error was not the result of a security breach or vulnerability. Hobbs said her office was notified from a county official that an early ballot report they compiled included ""protected voters,"" or those whose information is protected due to their jobs or if they were victims of certain crimes. Seventy-eight names were mistakenly included in the reports, the secretary of state\'s office said, and the office has asked county officials to contact those who were directly impacted. The early ballot reports are produced using data from the state\'s voter registration database, and the reports are provided by counties to political parties during elections. Hobb\'s office said the process for producing reports from the voter registration database has also been updated to prevent future errors. Biden celebrated his early wins in Illinois and Florida with a solemn address to supporters calling for the country to come together in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, while also thanking Bernie Sanders and his supporters for the ""remarkable passion"" they have brought to the Democratic race. Speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, with a backdrop of black cloth and flanked by two American flags, Biden remarked that his campaign ""has had a very good night"" and is moving closer to securing the Democratic presidential nomination. He also thanked election officials and poll workers in the three states with in-person voting for ensuring people could cast their ballots while also remaining safe. ""It\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy,"" he said. Biden said that his campaign is building a broad coalition that includes support from African-Americans, the Latino community, labor, firefighters, teachers, suburban women and others. ""We\'re doing it with a common vision,"" he said, adding that he and Sanders share that vision. The former vice president also thanked Sanders and his supporters for bringing ""remarkable passion and tenacity"" to issues like healthcare, income inequality and climate change, and delivered a message directly to young Sanders supporters. ""To young votes who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you, I know what\'s at stake. I know what we have to do,"" he said. ""Our goal as a campaign and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party and to unify the nation."" Biden also praised Americans for altering their lives as public health officials rush to limit the spread of the coronavirus, saying that Americans are ""ordinary people doing extraordinary things when the need arises and today we are moving quickly to adapt our routines to meet this challenge."" ""It\'s in moments like these we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans,"" Biden said. ""The coronavirus doesn\'t care if you\'re a Democrat or Republican. It will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender or your zip code. It will touch people in positions of power as well as the most vulnerable people in our society. We\'re all in this together."" A large number of likely voters in Illinois, 87%, said they were concerned about coronavirus, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to the primary. Biden received the support of likely voters concerned about the coronavirus by about 2-to-1. Similar percentages of likely voters are worried about the direction of the nation\'s economy in 2021, and Biden received their support by a similar margin. Sixty-four percent of likely voters in the Illinois primary picked Biden over Sanders as the person they would trust more to handle a major crisis. Likely primary voters in Illinois said beating President Trump was more important to them than having a candidate who agreed with them on the issues, and 69% said Biden would have the better chance to defeat the incumbent president in November. Polling shows Biden with a commanding lead among black likely voters – getting 70% of those polled – but he also received a majority vote of white likely voters as well, securing the support of both whites with and without college degrees. He received the support of over half of men and nearly two-thirds of women. The generational divide seen throughout this election cycle was also apparent in Illinois, with Sanders taking the vast majority of likely voters under 45, and Biden getting the strong support among older voters. But older likely voters significantly outnumbered their younger counterparts: more than six in ten likely voters were over the age of 45. And while Sanders maintains strong support of likely voters who say they are very liberal – getting nearly two-thirds support among this group – they made up just over a quarter of those polled. Biden garnered strong support among likely voters who said they were ""somewhat liberal"", and did particularly well among moderates. CBS News estimates Illinois leans toward Biden. At the moment, Chicago looks to be very close between Biden and Sanders, but many more votes are expected to be counted. The current delegate allocation in Illinois has Biden with 33 delegates and Sanders with 21. There are 155 total delegates at stake in Illinois. Following wins in the Republican primaries in Illinois and Florida, President Trump has secured the delegates needed to win the Republican presidential nomination, CBS News projects. President Trump has clinched the Republican nomination.https://t.co/E3KhCZjESV pic.twitter.com/YNT7WliBd0 — CBS News (@CBSNews) March 18, 2020 Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel offered congratulations to Mr. Trump for ""officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for president."" Congratulations to Donald J. Trump on officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for President! His home state of Florida just delivered him the delegates he needed. Our party is united, our grassroots movement is fired up, and we are ready for FOUR MORE YEARS! pic.twitter.com/B4X9IaQp7f — Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) March 18, 2020 Mr. Trump had several early challengers for the Republican nomination, though most dropped out of the race. Only former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld remains in the race. Most likely voters in Florida said electability was a priority for them going into the primary, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to March 17. Seventy-three percent of likely voters also think Biden would have a good chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to just 21% who picked Sanders. Voters over age 45 were more likely to say they support Biden. Those who want the next president to return to Obama policies instead of more liberal policies said they would vote for Biden. Nearly half of Florida likely voters said Sanders\' issue positions were too liberal, but most said Biden\'s issue positions were about right. Florida likely voters said they trusted Biden over Sanders by a wide margin — 59% to 37% — to handle Social Security. anders addressed supporters in a livestreamed speech after polls closed in most of Florida and called for the country to come together as local, state and federal officials respond to the coronavirus. ""I think the main point to be made tonight is that in this moment of crisis, it is imperative that we stand together, understand that right now throughout this country, there are so many of our people wondering what\'s going to happen to me tomorrow?"" Sanders said. He added that ""this is a moment that we have got to be working together."" Sanders laid out a series of proposals he said he plans to present to Democratic leadership and said an adequate response will require an ""unprecedented"" amount of money."" Sanders estimated the price tag will top $2 trillion. The plans put forth by Sanders to bolster the response to the coronavirus include allowing Medicare to cover all medical bills during the public health crisis; increasing test kits for the coronavirus and the speed at which tests are processed; activating the National Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other military resources to help expand healthcare capacity; and using emergency authority to scale up production in the U.S. of critical supplies and protective equipment. Sanders also suggested a number of measures to mitigate the economic impacts for American workers and their families, including providing a $2,000 monthly cash payment to every household for the duration of the crisis, expanding Meals on Wheels and food stamps and placing a moratorium on evictions, foreclosures and utility shutoffs. ""We must make certain that the government is getting this money into the hands of working families and the most vulnerable as quickly as possible,"" he said. Sanders said the economic crisis should not be ""another money-making opportunity"" for large corporations and Wall Street. ""We\'ve got some major crisis, but I have the strong belief that if we work together, if we do not turn to fear and panic, but if we understand that the way we solve this is by going forward as one people, remembering those who are hurting tonight and will be hurting in the future,"" he said. ""This is the richest country in the history world. This is a country with unbelievable energy, with unbelievable talent, with incredible resources. We can do it. We can address this crisis, we can minimize the pain and let us do just that."" CBS News projects Biden will win Florida, the biggest prize in Tuesday\'s primaries with 219 pledged delegates. Florida has a large Hispanic population, and Biden has previously struggled to gain support from Hispanic voters in states which have already held primaries, like Nevada. The delegate allocation at poll closing in Florida was 100 delegates for Biden, and 27 for Sanders, according to CBS News\' analysis. All polls are now closed in Florida and in Illinois, after an election day marked by fears about the spread of the coronavirus. Polls close in Arizona at 10 p.m. ET. The Ohio primary has been pushed back until June 2. Sanders will livestream remarks about the coronavirus crisis at 7:15 p.m., shortly after polls close in Florida. The speech will address how the ""response to the outbreak should put working families and the most vulnerable first,"" according to a press release from the campaign. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democrats said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Biden and Sanders have made remarks outlining their plans to respond to the crisis. The Florida Democratic Party said the number of Democrats who have voted early in person and by mail has exceeded turnout in the primaries in 2016. According to the state party, 141,560 more Democrats voted by mail this year than they did in the last presidential primary. Additionally, 74,031 more Democrats voted early in person this year than in 2016. The Florida Democratic Party also said it enrolled nearly 500,000 new Democrats into vote-by-mail in 2018. The party said that the coronavirus pandemic, which has impacted voting in states holding their contests today, demonstrates the need for the government to revamp voting methods. As the country deals with a health care crisis, the issue of health care remains on voters\' minds. In Arizona, Florida, and Illinois, voters picked health care as the issue that would be most important in determining their vote, according to CBS News primary polls. The second most important issue among voters in each of the three states was income inequality, followed by climate change and race relations. Likely Democratic voters in Illinois said they are also worried about the economy, primary polls show. More than eight in 10 are least somewhat concerned about the national economy over the next year. In the three states where voters will head to the polls Tuesday, most said they prefer the Democratic nominee be someone who can beat Trump — at least six in 10 in each state— over someone they agree with on major issues, according to CBS News primary polls. As has been the case throughout this campaign, there are high levels of dissatisfaction toward the Trump administration among the Democratic primary electorate. Large majorities of likely voters in Florida and Illinois and those who voted by mail in Arizona said they feel angry about the Trump administration. Among likely Democratic voters in Illinois, more Sanders supporters said they would be unhappy about Biden being the nominee than Biden supporters would be if Sanders became the nominee, according to primary polls. Fifty-four percent of Sanders supporters would be dissatisfied or upset if Biden won the nomination, compared to 37% of Biden backers who would feel that way if Sanders became the nominee. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democratic voters said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Among those polled in Florida, 71% said they trusted Biden more, compared to 23% who said Sanders is the candidate they trust to handle a major crisis. In Illinois, 64% of Democratic voters selected Biden while 31% said Sanders is more trusted, and in Arizona, 63% said they trust Biden more to handle a major crisis compared to 31%, who pointed to Sanders. The Democratic National Committee is calling on states that haven\'t yet held their primaries to vote by mail, as coronavirus threatens future primaries. ""The simplest tool is vote by mail, which is already in use in a number of states and should be made available to all registered voters. States using vote by mail should proactively mail ballots to registered voters, where feasible, and should count all ballots as long as they are postmarked by the date of the primary,"" DNC chair Tom Perez said in a statement on Wednesday. Where in-person voting can take place in accordance with health guidelines, states should expand the days and hours of early voting to cut down on lines, Perez added. According to CBS News primary polls, nearly all likely voters in Illinois expressed at least some concern about the effects of the coronavirus, including more than half who said they are very concerned about it. Most likely voters of all ages in Illinois said they are concerned, but older voters are particularly so: 62% of voters ages 45 and over say they are very concerned, compared to 38% of younger voters. Women (59%) were also more likely than men (46%) to be very concerned. Some voters, meanwhile, said the coronavirus could change their decision to vote. In Florida, among those who said they would definitely vote and planned to do so in person on Election Day, 15% said it was very or somewhat likely that they could change their decision to vote. In Illinois, that figure was 9%, according to primary polls. The Biden campaign is optimistic it will walk away from Tuesday\'s primaries with a wider delegate lead than it had going into the contests despite the challenges to voter turnout raised because of the coronavirus. ""It would take a drastic, historically-incomparable swing for Senator Sanders to win more delegates than Biden today or to close the delegate differential,"" the campaign said in a memo released Tuesday. Heading into the four primaries held on Tuesday, Biden led Sanders by more than 100 delegates. The former vice president\'s campaign also noted that while fewer people may head to the polls on Election Day because of the coronavirus, it expects overall turnout to match that of past elections. ""While voter turnout on Election Day itself may be lower due to COVID-19 concerns, we believe that, with early vote and vote by mail, overall turnout will be roughly on pace for 2016 in Arizona and Florida and roughly on pace for 2018 in Illinois, and that voter turnout in all three states will reflect the population at large,"" the campaign said in the memo. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, on Tuesday defended the decision to keep the polls open despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. ""There are people out there today who want to say, \'Oh, it\'s a crisis, bend the rules and overstep your authority,\'"" Pritzker said. ""Let me tell you this, It is exactly in times like these, when the constitutional boundaries of our democracy should be respected above all else. And if people want to criticize me for that, well, go ahead. I\'ll wear it like a badge of honor."" Earlier Tuesday, Chicago Board of Elections spokesman Jim Allen said he urged Pritzker to prohibit voting in person and go fully vote-by-mail. Allen later apologized for the remarks. The Chicago Board of Elections said they said they\'ve had to move in total 200 precincts, with some locations in the city dropping out as soon as this morning (these cases were immediately moved to a new location). In Chicago, 126,499 votes have been cast through 2 p.m. ET, with a surge after the first two hours. Biden tweeted a reminder about polls being open in Arizona, Florida and Illinois. ""I encourage folks to vote by mail or curbside vote if you can,"" Biden wrote. ""If you vote in person, please wash your hands, don\'t touch your face, and stay 6\' from others in line."" Maryland Governor Larry Hogan announced at a press conference on Tuesday morning that the state will move its primary from April 28 until June 2. The state Board of Elections issued a statement shortly after that ""fully supports"" Hogan\'s decision. The decision follows similar action in Georgia, Kentucky and Louisiana. In a last-minute move on Monday, Ohio postponed its primary. The Ohio State Supreme Court denied a challenge to Ohio\'s primary delay filed by Wood County judicial candidate Corey Speweik, who was fighting the state of Ohio\'s decision to shut down Tuesday\'s primary and postpone voting until June over concern about the spread of the coronavirus. The process leading up to the delay was chaotic. With less than 12 hours to go before polls were scheduled to open in Ohio for the state\'s presidential primary election, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, announced polls would remain closed Tuesday amid concerns over the coronavirus. The decision came just hours after a Franklin County judge denied a request backed by the governor and secretary of state to delay the election. The Ohio Democratic Party said in a statement Tuesday that although voting did not seem feasible, it hoped the primary would be rescheduled for earlier than June 2. ""Given the chaos, confusion and mixed messages of the past 24 hours, it\'s clearly impossible for in-person voting to move forward today in Ohio,"" the party said in a statement. ""The Ohio Democratic Party strongly supports concluding the primary election earlier than June 2. Extending for that long is highly problematic for any number for reasons, and it is not at all clear that in-person voting will be possible on that date anyway,"" the statement continued. At a news conference Monday, in response to a question about the possible impact of the coronavirus outbreak, President Trump said delaying elections would be ""not a very good thing."" ""I\'d leave that up to the states,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Postponing elections is not a very good thing … I think postponing is unnecessary."" A poll by Monmouth University released on Monday showed Biden with a double-digit advantage over Sanders in Arizona. Among voters likely to participate in the primary, Biden was supported by 51% to Sanders\' 31%. Sanders leads among Latino voters by seven points, and among voters under 50 years old by wide margins. But this is more than offset by Biden\'s strong advantage among larger voter blocs, including white voters and those aged 50 and over. In head-to-head matchups with the president, Biden had a small edge Mr. Trump, but the president was virtually tied with Sanders. Although Arizona has long been a solid red state, it could be a battleground this November. Mr. Trump only won the state by 4 points against Hillary Clinton in 2016. In the Senate race, Democrat Mark Kelly had a 6-point edge in the poll over incumbent Martha McSally. "',
        AnswerContent: '"Check back for updates as polls close in three states amid the coronavirus pandemic. Former Vice President Joe Biden swept all three states voting Tuesday in a series of primaries that were heavily influenced by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. His last win of the night came in Arizona, where the Associated Press projected a victory through voter surveys. Biden secured early projected wins in Florida and Illinois, where he was long heavily favored to win, and he captured the state of Arizona shortly after polls there closed at 10 p.m. EDT. In all, more than 440 delegates were up for grabs in the latest round of voting, and Biden’s projected victories handed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders a formidable challenge to catch up. It was the first series of primaries to take place amid the national state of emergency President Donald Trump declared over the coronavirus pandemic, a circumstance that had the potential to upend the candidates’ messages as well as the technical process of running a primary election. The Democratic primary schedule has a bit of a lull for the next month. Puerto Rico holds a primary March 29. April 4 primaries include Hawaii with 24 delegates, Alaska with 15 and Wyoming’s caucuses with 14. Wisconsin has a primary April 7. And then on April 28, five states will make their choices, including New York with 274 delegates and Pennsylvania with 186 delegates. Ohioans were set to cast their ballots on Tuesday but state officials there announced they would postpone the election until sometime after the outbreak had passed. “This pandemic has impacted every aspect of our lives, and every aspect of this campaign,” Biden said in a video streamed from his home in Delaware, where he eschewed the traditional rally to deliver his election night remarks. “It’s at moments like these that we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans.” Both candidates avoided attacks on each other, or even discussing the latest contours of the race.    “In this moment of crisis it is imperative that we stand together,” Sanders said in his own video message. “This is a moment that we’ve got to be working together.” Heading into the election, Biden had a better than 153-delegate lead over Sanders.    Trump, who never faced a significant challenge, also swept the primaries Tuesday and exceeded the 1,276 delegates needed to become the GOP’s presumptive nominee. As Arizona’s polls closed Tuesday with uncertain results, former Vice President Joe Biden looked to add to his Democratic primary wins in Florida and Illinois against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, according to Associated Press projections from voter surveys. Biden’s victories came on the same night President Donald Trump locked up the Republican nomination for his re-election. Biden said from his home in Wilmington, Del., that the victories demonstrated a broad coalition to beat Trump, including blacks, Hispanics, suburban women and veterans. He commended Sanders’ supporters and said they share a vision for affordable health care, a need to reduce income inequality and to fight climate change. “Sen. Sanders and I may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision,” Biden said. “Sen. Sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all of these issues.” Florida offered the biggest prize for Biden, with 219 pledged delegates. At stake in Illinois were 155 delegates and in Arizona were 67 delegates. Ohio, with 136 delegates, postponed its vote because of concerns about coronavirus. The virus declared a worldwide pandemic wreaked havoc with the primaries in all three states, according to voting advocates. Poll workers failed to show up to work. Election officials closed polling places for lack of staff and to move them away from residential facilities for the elderly. And workers lacked wipes and hand sanitizer to reduce the spread of disease. “This pandemic has impacted every aspect of our life, and every aspect of this campaign,” Biden said. “Tackling this pandemic is a national emergency akin to fighting a war.” But the victories built on Biden’s lead toward meeting the 1,991 delegates needed to clinch the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. Biden had at least 1,121 delegates, compared to 839 for Sanders, according to an AP tabulation. Political experts say the remaining states offer little chance for Sanders to make large enough strides to overtake Biden. For example, the Florida win continued Biden’s successful march across the south, after South Carolina revived his campaign Feb. 29. He swept southern states on March 3 Super Tuesday. Still ahead are Georgia May 19 and Louisiana on June 20. The Democratic primary schedule has a bit of a lull for the next month. Puerto Rico holds a primary March 29. April 4 primaries include Hawaii with 24 delegates, Alaska with 15 and Wyoming’s caucuses with 14. Wisconsin has a primary April 7. And then on April 28, five states will make their choices, including New York with 274 delegates and Pennsylvania with 186 delegates. By winning the Florida and Illinois Republican primaries Tuesday night, President Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican party presidential nominee. He exceeded the 1,276 delegates needed to secure the nomination. “The Republican Party is more unified and energized than ever before and it’s because of President Trump’s leadership and clear record of accomplishment on behalf of all Americans,” Brad Parscale, Trump’s 2020 campaign manager said in a statement. Trump easily won every state that held a contest in the Republican primary. Former Vice President Joe Biden has beaten Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Illinois Democratic primary, according to Associated Press projections from voter surveys. The projected outcome, though not unexpected, will further cement Biden’s place as the clear frontrunner in the race for the Democratic nomination. The former vice president started his day Tuesday with a more than 153-delegate lead over Sanders. Voting in Illinois was set to wrap up at 8 p.m. EDT but was extended by an hour in dozens of Cook County precincts. Polling this month had put Biden ahead in Illinois with a large double-digit margin, and so the outcome in the Prairie State had long been forecast. On the other hand, coronavirus fears and early reports of low turnout in the state had raised questions about the predictive value of recent polling. There are 155 delegates at stake in Illinois, the second-largest delegate haul of the three states in play on Tuesday.  Voters in Florida and Arizona were also picking a Democratic candidate Tuesday in the first series of primary elections since the coronavirus has been thrust to the forefront of American consciousness. Biden posted a tweet Tuesday encouraging voters to cast a ballot curbside or by mail, if possible. Former Vice President Joe Biden has beaten Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in Florida’s Democratic primary, the biggest prize among Tuesday’s primaries with 219 pledged delegates, according to Associated Press projections from voter surveys.  The victory continues Biden’s sweep of southern states in the quest to challenge President Donald Trump in November. Illinois was also voting with 155 delegates and Arizona had 67 delegates at stake. Ohio, with 136 delegates, postponed its vote because of concerns about coronavirus. Biden’s win came as no surprise, after leading an average of statewide polling through Tuesday with 64% to 25% for Sanders, according to the tracking site FiveThirtyEight.com. One key distinction between the candidates in Florida, which is home to about 1.5 million Cuban Americans, was over U.S. policy toward the island nation.  Sanders, a Democratic socialist, has praised the literacy programs of Fidel Castro, the late dictator whose control over Cuba led to an estrangement from the U.S. for 50 years. But Biden criticized Sanders for supposing communists in Cuba and other authoritarian regimes. The Chicago Board of Elections is fighting to extend voting in five precincts by an hour Tuesday night amid low turnout due to the coronavirus outbreak. Reports of numerous polling places without necessary equipment or poll workers popped up during the day, as election officials blamed the state’s governor not postponing the primary in light of the outbreak. Jim Allen, spokesman for the Chicago Board of Election, told reporters the board asked the state last week to either delay the primary or move to a mail-in only race, multiple media outlets reported. The governor\'s office has disputed this ""as a lie."" According to the Chicago Board of Elections, those five precincts “will be open until 8 pm pending court order. All remaining precincts close at 7 pm.” Across the state of Illinois, and the country, efforts to contain the virus has escalated with thousands of schools temporarily closing, and restaurants shuttering to only provide take out or delivery services.  Trump on Monday issued guidelines that called for Americans to avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people. The 2020 Democratic primary broke the city’s record for early voting in a primary, with more than 145,000 people going to the polls early, according to the Chicago Tribune. But, election Day voter turnout in Chicago remained dismal through the night, with the voter turnout at just over 267,000 people of 6 pm.  The Chicago Board of Elections tweeted earlier: “This primary is happening in extraordinary times that we have never seen before. We admire the strength of all Chicagoans that are helping ensure our democracy continues today.” The Ohio Democratic Party sued election officials on Tuesday over their unusual decision to cancel in-person voting in the Buckeye State’s presidential primary because of the coronavirus, the latest legal fight to crop up over the move. Democrats sued Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, arguing he does not have the legal authority to reschedule a make-up election absent action from state lawmakers. Instead of setting a new election unilaterally, the suit seeks an extension of absentee balloting until late April. Democrats, who filed the suit in the Ohio Supreme Court, said the litigation was intended in part to preserve the option of a future election. Without it, they said, they are concerned that they might not get another shot at in-person voting.  ""This primary election must move forward,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. “Yesterday’s actions did not create unchecked authority with the governor or secretary of state to run a new election."" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced that the state would push back its election, originally scheduled for Tuesday, to June 2 because of coronavirus fears. But Democratic officials have urged states that have yet to hold their primaries to avoid changing dates. Ohio is one of several states, along with Louisiana, Kentucky and Maryland, that have postponed voting because of the virus. National party officials have requested that states “use a variety of other critical mechanisms” rather than moving primaries. Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez said Tuesday that it is “critical that states provide clarity and not confusion, which could lead to disenfranchising voters.” CHICAGO -- Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Chicago election officials feuded Tuesday over the state’s decision to push ahead with voting despite health concerns from the coronavirus pandemic. Election Day voter turnout in Chicago was dismal – around 126,000 by 1 p.m. – below even local mayoral elections in the city and one-third the turnout pace of the 2020 primary election. In the separate suburban Cook County, 119,000 had voted by 3 p.m., also vastly below past primary turnouts. Jim Allen, spokesman for the Chicago Board of Election, told reporters the board asked the state last week to either delay the primary or move to a mail-in only race, multiple media outlets reported. That drew a sharply worded tweet from Anne Caprara, Pritzker’s chief of staff: “This is a lie. And frankly, given what we are dealing with in this moment, I’m disgusted that Jim Allen would lie like this,” Caprara said. “We offered them the national guard, young volunteers and assistance with keeping polling places clean.” In another tweet, she added: “The Governor has been trying to balance continuity of government, not disenfranchising people who already voted, avoiding a legal crisis & keeping everyone safe. The Chicago Board of Elections have been worried about scoring cheap political points.” Although Election Day turnout will likely remain low in Chicago, the overall numbers could be lifted by strong early-voting figures. The 2020 Democratic primary broke the city’s record for early voting in a primary, with more than 145,000 people going to the polls early, according to the Chicago Tribune. It eclipsed the 140,000 who voted early in Chicago in the 2016 Democratic Primary. The city also broke a World War II-era record with 118,000 vote-by-mail ballot requests. Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden is the heavy favorite to win the most delegates in Illinois. The last two polls taken of likely Democratic voters in Illinois each found Biden ahead of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders by more than 20 percentage points. The Democratic National Committee is urging states who have yet to hold their primaries to avoid changing primary dates due to the coronavirus pandemic. DNC chairman Tom Perez said in a statement that states should instead  “use a variety of other critical mechanisms that will make voting easier and safer for voters and election officials alike,” instead “of moving primaries to later in the cycle when timing around the virus remains unpredictable.” He noted that states should use a vote-by-mail system or if they can still vote in-person under public health guidelines, then they should expand days and hours of early voting to reduce lines on Election Day.  ""As our country deals with the uncertainty of COVID-19, it is critical that states provide clarity and not confusion, which could lead to disenfranchising voters,” Perez said in the statement. The statement comes less than 24 hours after Ohio postponed their primary election last minute. The state’s primary was supposed to be held Tuesday and a new date has yet to be set. Several other states, including Louisiana, Kentucky and Maryland, have also postponed their primary dates. “What happened in Ohio last night has only bred more chaos and confusion, and the Democratic Party leadership in Ohio is working tirelessly to protect the right to vote,” Perez said in a statement. “Eligible voters deserve certainty, safety, and accessibility.”  “The right to vote is the foundation of our democracy, and we must do everything we can to protect and expand that right instead of bringing our democratic process to a halt,” Perez concluded. In a primary election suddenly consumed by fears about the coronavirus pandemic, seven in ten Florida voters said they trust former Vice President Joe Biden more than Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to handle a crisis, according to an NBC report on the poll. The results were widely consistent across the states voting Tuesday, the first to cast a ballot amid an outbreak of COVID-19 that has disrupted the routines of millions of Americans. More than six in 10 Illinois voters and 63% of Arizona voters said they would trust Biden more than Sanders to handle a crisis. Because of the virus and increasingly stringent requests for social distancing, the National Election Pool did not conduct in-person exit polls for Tuesday\'s primaries, NBC reported. Instead, the outlets conducted a telephone survey of voters before Tuesday\'s vote. After some Florida polling sites opened late Tuesday, Florida election officials defended their decision to press forward with its presidential primaries amid a global coronavirus pandemic. Secretary of State Laurel Lee said one precinct in Broward County opened late but was ""up and running,"" The Tallahassee Democrat reported, and there were ""isolated precincts in Palm Beach County that have had some challenges."" ""All other counties reported on-time opening of all voting locations around the state,"" she said. Lee said voters who did not want to go to polling sites over health concerns could pick up vote-by-mail ballots and turn them in by 7 p.m. EDT. A group of civils rights organizations, including the New Florida Majority, LatinoJustice and Dream Defenders, sued Lee and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in federal court Monday, seeking to extend vote-by-mail deadlines through March 27, to allow people concerned about going to precincts a chance to vote. WASHINGTON – Democratic primary voters in Florida, Illinois and Arizona found some confusion at polling places that moved or closed because of coronavirus, but voting advocates said Tuesday that turnout might still eclipse the 2016 primary. Alex Gulotta, Arizona state director of the advocacy group All Voting Is Local, said concerns about coronavirus prompted officials to close polling places, which confused voters about where to go. In Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, the number of polling places dropped from 240 to 151, but anyone who is registered could vote at any of them. But while in-person voting was running low at about 20% of expectations, more people voted already by mail than in 2016, Gulotta said. “We’ve had enormous turnout by mail,” he said. “Turnout has been very low today, but overall, voting is more than 2016.” Jay Young, executive director of Common Cause Illinois, said problems emerged early with election judges who didn’t show up and polling places closed. Poll workers complained about a lack of wipes or hand sanitizer, he said. “Here in Illinois, it’s been a hectic and trying day,” he said, with in-person turnout running about one-third the rate of previous primaries. Liza McClenaghan, board chair for Common Cause Florida, said a number of poll workers in Palm Beach County didn’t report to work Tuesday. Some had keys to polling places, which prevented them opening, and others had keys to equipment, which prevented using them, she said. The county invited voters to visit one of four election offices, or to mail in ballots. But McClenaghan said elderly voters have been asking where to vote as they discovered closed polling places and were suspicious of having mail-in ballots delivered by strangers. “We’ve had a dog’s breakfast about information for poll closings,” McClenaghan said. “We hope things improve shortly.” Karen Hobert Flynn, president of Common Cause, said the challenges in the primaries will give election officials an opportunity to find remedies such as allowing more mail-in voting by the November election. “Today we’re faced with a challenge unlike anything we’ve seen in our 50 years of advocacy, a global pandemic where all 50 states have now declared a state of emergency,” she said. WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. – Palm Beach County, Florida faced a shortage in poll workers Tuesday morning as Florida held its presidential primary amid the nation’s coronavirus pandemic. Some voters found closed doors when they arrived at their voting sites, The Palm Beach Post reported. Some locations opened late but others remained closed, prompting officials to allow voters pick up vote-by-mail ballots at any of the county’s election offices. Ahead of Election Day, around 800 poll workers notified Palm Beach elected officials they would not work because of concerns about the COVID-19 outbreak, leaving nearly 3,000 workers to cover Palm Beach County’s 454 voting sites. Penny Powell of West Palm Beach told The Post she went to her polling place, Pine Jog Environmental Center, to find it closed. She said a park worker sent her to the Supervisor of Elections\' main office, where she was able to vote. “They’re both close to each other so it wasn’t out of the way,” she said. “So I’m good with it.” She did not know why her location was not open. Former Vice President Joe Biden is heavily favored to defeat Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in Florida’s Democratic presidential primary. But turnout is a major wild card, particularly with the possibility it could disproportionately dissuade senior voters from the polls. Biden performs better among old voters while young voters overwhelmingly back Sanders. At one Palm Beach County location, the King’s Point clubhouse west of Delray Beach, only 32 people had voted as of noon. Poll workers there said they expected a low turnout because of the coronavirus. But at other locations, voters said they waited in line for nearly an hour. As coronavirus precautions, voters are told to space out six feet apart as they wait to vote. WASHINGTON – Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced Tuesday his state would postpone its primary, moving it from April 28 to June 2. The move comes as Arizona, Florida, and Illinois hold their Democratic presidential primary elections Tuesday. Ohio closed its polling places after Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, declared a ""health emergency."" ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at a unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said in a release late Monday.  The virus, which has been named COVID-19, already appears to have depressed turnout in morning voting in Chicago. The Chicago Board of Elections said there was ""extremely low turnout"" in morning voting. From 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. EDT, only 10,000 votes were cast, the Board said, as opposed to 30,000 votes that would be cast in a low turnout election.  Former Vice President Joe Biden currently leads the national delegate count with 898, whereas Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has 745 delegates. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, has two delegates.  Former Vice President Joe Biden is heavily favored to defeat Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders as Arizona Democrats head to the polls for the state’s primary election amid the global pandemic. Maricopa County election officials, in reaction to the coronavirus, closed 80 polling places and made the remaining 151 voting locations ""vote centers,” allowing voters to vote at any location, not just the one in their neighborhood.   Sanders visited Phoenix earlier this month to bolster his campaign. He is counting on the state\'s significant Latino population to provide a boost for him, but recent polling suggests he remains well behind here. --Ronald J. Hansen and Yvonne Wingett Sanchez, Arizona Republic."',

        ArticleContent: '"Joe Biden swept all three primaries on Tuesday night in Arizona, Florida and Illinois, CBS News projects. The contests took place amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis that led Ohio officials to postpone their primary, which had also been scheduled for Tuesday. In remarks after his early win in Florida, Biden, speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, said his campaign appeared to have had a ""very good night,"" but he also spoke about the coronavirus crisis. He told Americans that ""it\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy."" Bernie Sanders gave remarks via livestream earlier in the night. He focused mainly on the coronavirus crisis and highlighted unity. Tuesday\'s lopsided results will expand the divide in delegates between Biden and Sanders. It\'s unclear when the next primary contests will be held. Georgia, which had been set to vote on March 24, has postponed its primary, as did Louisiana, which was scheduled to go to the polls on April 4. As of 12 a.m. ET on Wednesday, Biden had increased his lead to 291 delegates. Biden now has 1,093 delegates to Sanders\' 802. To get the nomination, the Democratic candidate will need 1,991 delegates. According to CBS News primary polling in Arizona, the most important candidate quality for voters was being able to unite the country. Of those voters, 65% said they voted for Biden, while just 16% went for Sanders. The poll was mostly of voters who already voted by mail and includes those who said they were likely to show up at polls today. Like Florida and Illinois voters, 69% of Arizona voters saw Biden as the candidate with the best chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to 26% who believed the same of Sanders. Biden was also seen as the candidate trusted more to handle a major crisis. Biden led among white voters by 51% to 32%. Hispanic voters were more evenly divided: Biden 45% to Sanders 44%. CBS News projects the former vice president wins the Arizona primary, finalizing Biden\'s sweep of the three states that voted. Sixty-seven pledged delegates are up for grabs in Arizona. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose cheered the decision to postpone the state\'s primary election until June 2, saying it ""saved Ohio lives."" ""By preventing Ohioans from going to polling locations, we averted a situation which would have gone against the most recent scientific evidence available and could have dangerously advanced the spread of coronavirus across Ohio,"" the two said in a joining statement. ""It is abundantly clear that it would have been impossible to carry out a fair, accessible, and safe election today."" DeWine and LaRose stressed that Ohio voters should have a ""significant"" amount of time to cast mail-in absentee ballots and also vote in-person. Less than 12 hours before the polls were set to open in Ohio, DeWine announced that Dr. Amy Acton, director of the Ohio Department of Health, would be issuing an order to close polls ""to avoid the imminent threat with the high probability of widespread exposure to COVID-19."" As of 11 p.m. ET, Biden is leading in every county in Florida. Although Hillary Clinton won the primary in 2016, Sanders won nine counties in the northern part of the state in that contest. The Arizona secretary of state has revealed that personal information related to some protected voters was erroneously included in reports generated from the state\'s voter registration database. Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said in a statement that the error was not the result of a security breach or vulnerability. Hobbs said her office was notified from a county official that an early ballot report they compiled included ""protected voters,"" or those whose information is protected due to their jobs or if they were victims of certain crimes. Seventy-eight names were mistakenly included in the reports, the secretary of state\'s office said, and the office has asked county officials to contact those who were directly impacted. The early ballot reports are produced using data from the state\'s voter registration database, and the reports are provided by counties to political parties during elections. Hobb\'s office said the process for producing reports from the voter registration database has also been updated to prevent future errors. Biden celebrated his early wins in Illinois and Florida with a solemn address to supporters calling for the country to come together in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, while also thanking Bernie Sanders and his supporters for the ""remarkable passion"" they have brought to the Democratic race. Speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, with a backdrop of black cloth and flanked by two American flags, Biden remarked that his campaign ""has had a very good night"" and is moving closer to securing the Democratic presidential nomination. He also thanked election officials and poll workers in the three states with in-person voting for ensuring people could cast their ballots while also remaining safe. ""It\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy,"" he said. Biden said that his campaign is building a broad coalition that includes support from African-Americans, the Latino community, labor, firefighters, teachers, suburban women and others. ""We\'re doing it with a common vision,"" he said, adding that he and Sanders share that vision. The former vice president also thanked Sanders and his supporters for bringing ""remarkable passion and tenacity"" to issues like healthcare, income inequality and climate change, and delivered a message directly to young Sanders supporters. ""To young votes who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you, I know what\'s at stake. I know what we have to do,"" he said. ""Our goal as a campaign and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party and to unify the nation."" Biden also praised Americans for altering their lives as public health officials rush to limit the spread of the coronavirus, saying that Americans are ""ordinary people doing extraordinary things when the need arises and today we are moving quickly to adapt our routines to meet this challenge."" ""It\'s in moments like these we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans,"" Biden said. ""The coronavirus doesn\'t care if you\'re a Democrat or Republican. It will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender or your zip code. It will touch people in positions of power as well as the most vulnerable people in our society. We\'re all in this together."" A large number of likely voters in Illinois, 87%, said they were concerned about coronavirus, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to the primary. Biden received the support of likely voters concerned about the coronavirus by about 2-to-1. Similar percentages of likely voters are worried about the direction of the nation\'s economy in 2021, and Biden received their support by a similar margin. Sixty-four percent of likely voters in the Illinois primary picked Biden over Sanders as the person they would trust more to handle a major crisis. Likely primary voters in Illinois said beating President Trump was more important to them than having a candidate who agreed with them on the issues, and 69% said Biden would have the better chance to defeat the incumbent president in November. Polling shows Biden with a commanding lead among black likely voters – getting 70% of those polled – but he also received a majority vote of white likely voters as well, securing the support of both whites with and without college degrees. He received the support of over half of men and nearly two-thirds of women. The generational divide seen throughout this election cycle was also apparent in Illinois, with Sanders taking the vast majority of likely voters under 45, and Biden getting the strong support among older voters. But older likely voters significantly outnumbered their younger counterparts: more than six in ten likely voters were over the age of 45. And while Sanders maintains strong support of likely voters who say they are very liberal – getting nearly two-thirds support among this group – they made up just over a quarter of those polled. Biden garnered strong support among likely voters who said they were ""somewhat liberal"", and did particularly well among moderates. CBS News estimates Illinois leans toward Biden. At the moment, Chicago looks to be very close between Biden and Sanders, but many more votes are expected to be counted. The current delegate allocation in Illinois has Biden with 33 delegates and Sanders with 21. There are 155 total delegates at stake in Illinois. Following wins in the Republican primaries in Illinois and Florida, President Trump has secured the delegates needed to win the Republican presidential nomination, CBS News projects. President Trump has clinched the Republican nomination.https://t.co/E3KhCZjESV pic.twitter.com/YNT7WliBd0 — CBS News (@CBSNews) March 18, 2020 Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel offered congratulations to Mr. Trump for ""officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for president."" Congratulations to Donald J. Trump on officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for President! His home state of Florida just delivered him the delegates he needed. Our party is united, our grassroots movement is fired up, and we are ready for FOUR MORE YEARS! pic.twitter.com/B4X9IaQp7f — Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) March 18, 2020 Mr. Trump had several early challengers for the Republican nomination, though most dropped out of the race. Only former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld remains in the race. Most likely voters in Florida said electability was a priority for them going into the primary, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to March 17. Seventy-three percent of likely voters also think Biden would have a good chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to just 21% who picked Sanders. Voters over age 45 were more likely to say they support Biden. Those who want the next president to return to Obama policies instead of more liberal policies said they would vote for Biden. Nearly half of Florida likely voters said Sanders\' issue positions were too liberal, but most said Biden\'s issue positions were about right. Florida likely voters said they trusted Biden over Sanders by a wide margin — 59% to 37% — to handle Social Security. anders addressed supporters in a livestreamed speech after polls closed in most of Florida and called for the country to come together as local, state and federal officials respond to the coronavirus. ""I think the main point to be made tonight is that in this moment of crisis, it is imperative that we stand together, understand that right now throughout this country, there are so many of our people wondering what\'s going to happen to me tomorrow?"" Sanders said. He added that ""this is a moment that we have got to be working together."" Sanders laid out a series of proposals he said he plans to present to Democratic leadership and said an adequate response will require an ""unprecedented"" amount of money."" Sanders estimated the price tag will top $2 trillion. The plans put forth by Sanders to bolster the response to the coronavirus include allowing Medicare to cover all medical bills during the public health crisis; increasing test kits for the coronavirus and the speed at which tests are processed; activating the National Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other military resources to help expand healthcare capacity; and using emergency authority to scale up production in the U.S. of critical supplies and protective equipment. Sanders also suggested a number of measures to mitigate the economic impacts for American workers and their families, including providing a $2,000 monthly cash payment to every household for the duration of the crisis, expanding Meals on Wheels and food stamps and placing a moratorium on evictions, foreclosures and utility shutoffs. ""We must make certain that the government is getting this money into the hands of working families and the most vulnerable as quickly as possible,"" he said. Sanders said the economic crisis should not be ""another money-making opportunity"" for large corporations and Wall Street. ""We\'ve got some major crisis, but I have the strong belief that if we work together, if we do not turn to fear and panic, but if we understand that the way we solve this is by going forward as one people, remembering those who are hurting tonight and will be hurting in the future,"" he said. ""This is the richest country in the history world. This is a country with unbelievable energy, with unbelievable talent, with incredible resources. We can do it. We can address this crisis, we can minimize the pain and let us do just that."" CBS News projects Biden will win Florida, the biggest prize in Tuesday\'s primaries with 219 pledged delegates. Florida has a large Hispanic population, and Biden has previously struggled to gain support from Hispanic voters in states which have already held primaries, like Nevada. The delegate allocation at poll closing in Florida was 100 delegates for Biden, and 27 for Sanders, according to CBS News\' analysis. All polls are now closed in Florida and in Illinois, after an election day marked by fears about the spread of the coronavirus. Polls close in Arizona at 10 p.m. ET. The Ohio primary has been pushed back until June 2. Sanders will livestream remarks about the coronavirus crisis at 7:15 p.m., shortly after polls close in Florida. The speech will address how the ""response to the outbreak should put working families and the most vulnerable first,"" according to a press release from the campaign. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democrats said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Biden and Sanders have made remarks outlining their plans to respond to the crisis. The Florida Democratic Party said the number of Democrats who have voted early in person and by mail has exceeded turnout in the primaries in 2016. According to the state party, 141,560 more Democrats voted by mail this year than they did in the last presidential primary. Additionally, 74,031 more Democrats voted early in person this year than in 2016. The Florida Democratic Party also said it enrolled nearly 500,000 new Democrats into vote-by-mail in 2018. The party said that the coronavirus pandemic, which has impacted voting in states holding their contests today, demonstrates the need for the government to revamp voting methods. As the country deals with a health care crisis, the issue of health care remains on voters\' minds. In Arizona, Florida, and Illinois, voters picked health care as the issue that would be most important in determining their vote, according to CBS News primary polls. The second most important issue among voters in each of the three states was income inequality, followed by climate change and race relations. Likely Democratic voters in Illinois said they are also worried about the economy, primary polls show. More than eight in 10 are least somewhat concerned about the national economy over the next year. In the three states where voters will head to the polls Tuesday, most said they prefer the Democratic nominee be someone who can beat Trump — at least six in 10 in each state— over someone they agree with on major issues, according to CBS News primary polls. As has been the case throughout this campaign, there are high levels of dissatisfaction toward the Trump administration among the Democratic primary electorate. Large majorities of likely voters in Florida and Illinois and those who voted by mail in Arizona said they feel angry about the Trump administration. Among likely Democratic voters in Illinois, more Sanders supporters said they would be unhappy about Biden being the nominee than Biden supporters would be if Sanders became the nominee, according to primary polls. Fifty-four percent of Sanders supporters would be dissatisfied or upset if Biden won the nomination, compared to 37% of Biden backers who would feel that way if Sanders became the nominee. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democratic voters said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Among those polled in Florida, 71% said they trusted Biden more, compared to 23% who said Sanders is the candidate they trust to handle a major crisis. In Illinois, 64% of Democratic voters selected Biden while 31% said Sanders is more trusted, and in Arizona, 63% said they trust Biden more to handle a major crisis compared to 31%, who pointed to Sanders. The Democratic National Committee is calling on states that haven\'t yet held their primaries to vote by mail, as coronavirus threatens future primaries. ""The simplest tool is vote by mail, which is already in use in a number of states and should be made available to all registered voters. States using vote by mail should proactively mail ballots to registered voters, where feasible, and should count all ballots as long as they are postmarked by the date of the primary,"" DNC chair Tom Perez said in a statement on Wednesday. Where in-person voting can take place in accordance with health guidelines, states should expand the days and hours of early voting to cut down on lines, Perez added. According to CBS News primary polls, nearly all likely voters in Illinois expressed at least some concern about the effects of the coronavirus, including more than half who said they are very concerned about it. Most likely voters of all ages in Illinois said they are concerned, but older voters are particularly so: 62% of voters ages 45 and over say they are very concerned, compared to 38% of younger voters. Women (59%) were also more likely than men (46%) to be very concerned. Some voters, meanwhile, said the coronavirus could change their decision to vote. In Florida, among those who said they would definitely vote and planned to do so in person on Election Day, 15% said it was very or somewhat likely that they could change their decision to vote. In Illinois, that figure was 9%, according to primary polls. The Biden campaign is optimistic it will walk away from Tuesday\'s primaries with a wider delegate lead than it had going into the contests despite the challenges to voter turnout raised because of the coronavirus. ""It would take a drastic, historically-incomparable swing for Senator Sanders to win more delegates than Biden today or to close the delegate differential,"" the campaign said in a memo released Tuesday. Heading into the four primaries held on Tuesday, Biden led Sanders by more than 100 delegates. The former vice president\'s campaign also noted that while fewer people may head to the polls on Election Day because of the coronavirus, it expects overall turnout to match that of past elections. ""While voter turnout on Election Day itself may be lower due to COVID-19 concerns, we believe that, with early vote and vote by mail, overall turnout will be roughly on pace for 2016 in Arizona and Florida and roughly on pace for 2018 in Illinois, and that voter turnout in all three states will reflect the population at large,"" the campaign said in the memo. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, on Tuesday defended the decision to keep the polls open despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. ""There are people out there today who want to say, \'Oh, it\'s a crisis, bend the rules and overstep your authority,\'"" Pritzker said. ""Let me tell you this, It is exactly in times like these, when the constitutional boundaries of our democracy should be respected above all else. And if people want to criticize me for that, well, go ahead. I\'ll wear it like a badge of honor."" Earlier Tuesday, Chicago Board of Elections spokesman Jim Allen said he urged Pritzker to prohibit voting in person and go fully vote-by-mail. Allen later apologized for the remarks. The Chicago Board of Elections said they said they\'ve had to move in total 200 precincts, with some locations in the city dropping out as soon as this morning (these cases were immediately moved to a new location). In Chicago, 126,499 votes have been cast through 2 p.m. ET, with a surge after the first two hours. Biden tweeted a reminder about polls being open in Arizona, Florida and Illinois. ""I encourage folks to vote by mail or curbside vote if you can,"" Biden wrote. ""If you vote in person, please wash your hands, don\'t touch your face, and stay 6\' from others in line."" Maryland Governor Larry Hogan announced at a press conference on Tuesday morning that the state will move its primary from April 28 until June 2. The state Board of Elections issued a statement shortly after that ""fully supports"" Hogan\'s decision. The decision follows similar action in Georgia, Kentucky and Louisiana. In a last-minute move on Monday, Ohio postponed its primary. The Ohio State Supreme Court denied a challenge to Ohio\'s primary delay filed by Wood County judicial candidate Corey Speweik, who was fighting the state of Ohio\'s decision to shut down Tuesday\'s primary and postpone voting until June over concern about the spread of the coronavirus. The process leading up to the delay was chaotic. With less than 12 hours to go before polls were scheduled to open in Ohio for the state\'s presidential primary election, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, announced polls would remain closed Tuesday amid concerns over the coronavirus. The decision came just hours after a Franklin County judge denied a request backed by the governor and secretary of state to delay the election. The Ohio Democratic Party said in a statement Tuesday that although voting did not seem feasible, it hoped the primary would be rescheduled for earlier than June 2. ""Given the chaos, confusion and mixed messages of the past 24 hours, it\'s clearly impossible for in-person voting to move forward today in Ohio,"" the party said in a statement. ""The Ohio Democratic Party strongly supports concluding the primary election earlier than June 2. Extending for that long is highly problematic for any number for reasons, and it is not at all clear that in-person voting will be possible on that date anyway,"" the statement continued. At a news conference Monday, in response to a question about the possible impact of the coronavirus outbreak, President Trump said delaying elections would be ""not a very good thing."" ""I\'d leave that up to the states,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Postponing elections is not a very good thing … I think postponing is unnecessary."" A poll by Monmouth University released on Monday showed Biden with a double-digit advantage over Sanders in Arizona. Among voters likely to participate in the primary, Biden was supported by 51% to Sanders\' 31%. Sanders leads among Latino voters by seven points, and among voters under 50 years old by wide margins. But this is more than offset by Biden\'s strong advantage among larger voter blocs, including white voters and those aged 50 and over. In head-to-head matchups with the president, Biden had a small edge Mr. Trump, but the president was virtually tied with Sanders. Although Arizona has long been a solid red state, it could be a battleground this November. Mr. Trump only won the state by 4 points against Hillary Clinton in 2016. In the Senate race, Democrat Mark Kelly had a 6-point edge in the poll over incumbent Martha McSally. "',
        AnswerContent: '"Check back for updates as polls close in three states amid the coronavirus pandemic. Former Vice President Joe Biden swept all three states voting Tuesday in a series of primaries that were heavily influenced by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. His last win of the night came in Arizona, where the Associated Press projected a victory through voter surveys. Biden secured early projected wins in Florida and Illinois, where he was long heavily favored to win, and he captured the state of Arizona shortly after polls there closed at 10 p.m. EDT. In all, more than 440 delegates were up for grabs in the latest round of voting, and Biden’s projected victories handed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders a formidable challenge to catch up. It was the first series of primaries to take place amid the national state of emergency President Donald Trump declared over the coronavirus pandemic, a circumstance that had the potential to upend the candidates’ messages as well as the technical process of running a primary election. The Democratic primary schedule has a bit of a lull for the next month. Puerto Rico holds a primary March 29. April 4 primaries include Hawaii with 24 delegates, Alaska with 15 and Wyoming’s caucuses with 14. Wisconsin has a primary April 7. And then on April 28, five states will make their choices, including New York with 274 delegates and Pennsylvania with 186 delegates. Ohioans were set to cast their ballots on Tuesday but state officials there announced they would postpone the election until sometime after the outbreak had passed. “This pandemic has impacted every aspect of our lives, and every aspect of this campaign,” Biden said in a video streamed from his home in Delaware, where he eschewed the traditional rally to deliver his election night remarks. “It’s at moments like these that we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans.” Both candidates avoided attacks on each other, or even discussing the latest contours of the race.    “In this moment of crisis it is imperative that we stand together,” Sanders said in his own video message. “This is a moment that we’ve got to be working together.” Heading into the election, Biden had a better than 153-delegate lead over Sanders.    Trump, who never faced a significant challenge, also swept the primaries Tuesday and exceeded the 1,276 delegates needed to become the GOP’s presumptive nominee. As Arizona’s polls closed Tuesday with uncertain results, former Vice President Joe Biden looked to add to his Democratic primary wins in Florida and Illinois against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, according to Associated Press projections from voter surveys. Biden’s victories came on the same night President Donald Trump locked up the Republican nomination for his re-election. Biden said from his home in Wilmington, Del., that the victories demonstrated a broad coalition to beat Trump, including blacks, Hispanics, suburban women and veterans. He commended Sanders’ supporters and said they share a vision for affordable health care, a need to reduce income inequality and to fight climate change. “Sen. Sanders and I may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision,” Biden said. “Sen. Sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all of these issues.” Florida offered the biggest prize for Biden, with 219 pledged delegates. At stake in Illinois were 155 delegates and in Arizona were 67 delegates. Ohio, with 136 delegates, postponed its vote because of concerns about coronavirus. The virus declared a worldwide pandemic wreaked havoc with the primaries in all three states, according to voting advocates. Poll workers failed to show up to work. Election officials closed polling places for lack of staff and to move them away from residential facilities for the elderly. And workers lacked wipes and hand sanitizer to reduce the spread of disease. “This pandemic has impacted every aspect of our life, and every aspect of this campaign,” Biden said. “Tackling this pandemic is a national emergency akin to fighting a war.” But the victories built on Biden’s lead toward meeting the 1,991 delegates needed to clinch the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. Biden had at least 1,121 delegates, compared to 839 for Sanders, according to an AP tabulation. Political experts say the remaining states offer little chance for Sanders to make large enough strides to overtake Biden. For example, the Florida win continued Biden’s successful march across the south, after South Carolina revived his campaign Feb. 29. He swept southern states on March 3 Super Tuesday. Still ahead are Georgia May 19 and Louisiana on June 20. The Democratic primary schedule has a bit of a lull for the next month. Puerto Rico holds a primary March 29. April 4 primaries include Hawaii with 24 delegates, Alaska with 15 and Wyoming’s caucuses with 14. Wisconsin has a primary April 7. And then on April 28, five states will make their choices, including New York with 274 delegates and Pennsylvania with 186 delegates. By winning the Florida and Illinois Republican primaries Tuesday night, President Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican party presidential nominee. He exceeded the 1,276 delegates needed to secure the nomination. “The Republican Party is more unified and energized than ever before and it’s because of President Trump’s leadership and clear record of accomplishment on behalf of all Americans,” Brad Parscale, Trump’s 2020 campaign manager said in a statement. Trump easily won every state that held a contest in the Republican primary. Former Vice President Joe Biden has beaten Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Illinois Democratic primary, according to Associated Press projections from voter surveys. The projected outcome, though not unexpected, will further cement Biden’s place as the clear frontrunner in the race for the Democratic nomination. The former vice president started his day Tuesday with a more than 153-delegate lead over Sanders. Voting in Illinois was set to wrap up at 8 p.m. EDT but was extended by an hour in dozens of Cook County precincts. Polling this month had put Biden ahead in Illinois with a large double-digit margin, and so the outcome in the Prairie State had long been forecast. On the other hand, coronavirus fears and early reports of low turnout in the state had raised questions about the predictive value of recent polling. There are 155 delegates at stake in Illinois, the second-largest delegate haul of the three states in play on Tuesday.  Voters in Florida and Arizona were also picking a Democratic candidate Tuesday in the first series of primary elections since the coronavirus has been thrust to the forefront of American consciousness. Biden posted a tweet Tuesday encouraging voters to cast a ballot curbside or by mail, if possible. Former Vice President Joe Biden has beaten Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in Florida’s Democratic primary, the biggest prize among Tuesday’s primaries with 219 pledged delegates, according to Associated Press projections from voter surveys.  The victory continues Biden’s sweep of southern states in the quest to challenge President Donald Trump in November. Illinois was also voting with 155 delegates and Arizona had 67 delegates at stake. Ohio, with 136 delegates, postponed its vote because of concerns about coronavirus. Biden’s win came as no surprise, after leading an average of statewide polling through Tuesday with 64% to 25% for Sanders, according to the tracking site FiveThirtyEight.com. One key distinction between the candidates in Florida, which is home to about 1.5 million Cuban Americans, was over U.S. policy toward the island nation.  Sanders, a Democratic socialist, has praised the literacy programs of Fidel Castro, the late dictator whose control over Cuba led to an estrangement from the U.S. for 50 years. But Biden criticized Sanders for supposing communists in Cuba and other authoritarian regimes. The Chicago Board of Elections is fighting to extend voting in five precincts by an hour Tuesday night amid low turnout due to the coronavirus outbreak. Reports of numerous polling places without necessary equipment or poll workers popped up during the day, as election officials blamed the state’s governor not postponing the primary in light of the outbreak. Jim Allen, spokesman for the Chicago Board of Election, told reporters the board asked the state last week to either delay the primary or move to a mail-in only race, multiple media outlets reported. The governor\'s office has disputed this ""as a lie."" According to the Chicago Board of Elections, those five precincts “will be open until 8 pm pending court order. All remaining precincts close at 7 pm.” Across the state of Illinois, and the country, efforts to contain the virus has escalated with thousands of schools temporarily closing, and restaurants shuttering to only provide take out or delivery services.  Trump on Monday issued guidelines that called for Americans to avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people. The 2020 Democratic primary broke the city’s record for early voting in a primary, with more than 145,000 people going to the polls early, according to the Chicago Tribune. But, election Day voter turnout in Chicago remained dismal through the night, with the voter turnout at just over 267,000 people of 6 pm.  The Chicago Board of Elections tweeted earlier: “This primary is happening in extraordinary times that we have never seen before. We admire the strength of all Chicagoans that are helping ensure our democracy continues today.” The Ohio Democratic Party sued election officials on Tuesday over their unusual decision to cancel in-person voting in the Buckeye State’s presidential primary because of the coronavirus, the latest legal fight to crop up over the move. Democrats sued Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, arguing he does not have the legal authority to reschedule a make-up election absent action from state lawmakers. Instead of setting a new election unilaterally, the suit seeks an extension of absentee balloting until late April. Democrats, who filed the suit in the Ohio Supreme Court, said the litigation was intended in part to preserve the option of a future election. Without it, they said, they are concerned that they might not get another shot at in-person voting.  ""This primary election must move forward,"" said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. “Yesterday’s actions did not create unchecked authority with the governor or secretary of state to run a new election."" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced that the state would push back its election, originally scheduled for Tuesday, to June 2 because of coronavirus fears. But Democratic officials have urged states that have yet to hold their primaries to avoid changing dates. Ohio is one of several states, along with Louisiana, Kentucky and Maryland, that have postponed voting because of the virus. National party officials have requested that states “use a variety of other critical mechanisms” rather than moving primaries. Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez said Tuesday that it is “critical that states provide clarity and not confusion, which could lead to disenfranchising voters.” CHICAGO -- Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Chicago election officials feuded Tuesday over the state’s decision to push ahead with voting despite health concerns from the coronavirus pandemic. Election Day voter turnout in Chicago was dismal – around 126,000 by 1 p.m. – below even local mayoral elections in the city and one-third the turnout pace of the 2020 primary election. In the separate suburban Cook County, 119,000 had voted by 3 p.m., also vastly below past primary turnouts. Jim Allen, spokesman for the Chicago Board of Election, told reporters the board asked the state last week to either delay the primary or move to a mail-in only race, multiple media outlets reported. That drew a sharply worded tweet from Anne Caprara, Pritzker’s chief of staff: “This is a lie. And frankly, given what we are dealing with in this moment, I’m disgusted that Jim Allen would lie like this,” Caprara said. “We offered them the national guard, young volunteers and assistance with keeping polling places clean.” In another tweet, she added: “The Governor has been trying to balance continuity of government, not disenfranchising people who already voted, avoiding a legal crisis & keeping everyone safe. The Chicago Board of Elections have been worried about scoring cheap political points.” Although Election Day turnout will likely remain low in Chicago, the overall numbers could be lifted by strong early-voting figures. The 2020 Democratic primary broke the city’s record for early voting in a primary, with more than 145,000 people going to the polls early, according to the Chicago Tribune. It eclipsed the 140,000 who voted early in Chicago in the 2016 Democratic Primary. The city also broke a World War II-era record with 118,000 vote-by-mail ballot requests. Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden is the heavy favorite to win the most delegates in Illinois. The last two polls taken of likely Democratic voters in Illinois each found Biden ahead of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders by more than 20 percentage points. The Democratic National Committee is urging states who have yet to hold their primaries to avoid changing primary dates due to the coronavirus pandemic. DNC chairman Tom Perez said in a statement that states should instead  “use a variety of other critical mechanisms that will make voting easier and safer for voters and election officials alike,” instead “of moving primaries to later in the cycle when timing around the virus remains unpredictable.” He noted that states should use a vote-by-mail system or if they can still vote in-person under public health guidelines, then they should expand days and hours of early voting to reduce lines on Election Day.  ""As our country deals with the uncertainty of COVID-19, it is critical that states provide clarity and not confusion, which could lead to disenfranchising voters,” Perez said in the statement. The statement comes less than 24 hours after Ohio postponed their primary election last minute. The state’s primary was supposed to be held Tuesday and a new date has yet to be set. Several other states, including Louisiana, Kentucky and Maryland, have also postponed their primary dates. “What happened in Ohio last night has only bred more chaos and confusion, and the Democratic Party leadership in Ohio is working tirelessly to protect the right to vote,” Perez said in a statement. “Eligible voters deserve certainty, safety, and accessibility.”  “The right to vote is the foundation of our democracy, and we must do everything we can to protect and expand that right instead of bringing our democratic process to a halt,” Perez concluded. In a primary election suddenly consumed by fears about the coronavirus pandemic, seven in ten Florida voters said they trust former Vice President Joe Biden more than Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to handle a crisis, according to an NBC report on the poll. The results were widely consistent across the states voting Tuesday, the first to cast a ballot amid an outbreak of COVID-19 that has disrupted the routines of millions of Americans. More than six in 10 Illinois voters and 63% of Arizona voters said they would trust Biden more than Sanders to handle a crisis. Because of the virus and increasingly stringent requests for social distancing, the National Election Pool did not conduct in-person exit polls for Tuesday\'s primaries, NBC reported. Instead, the outlets conducted a telephone survey of voters before Tuesday\'s vote. After some Florida polling sites opened late Tuesday, Florida election officials defended their decision to press forward with its presidential primaries amid a global coronavirus pandemic. Secretary of State Laurel Lee said one precinct in Broward County opened late but was ""up and running,"" The Tallahassee Democrat reported, and there were ""isolated precincts in Palm Beach County that have had some challenges."" ""All other counties reported on-time opening of all voting locations around the state,"" she said. Lee said voters who did not want to go to polling sites over health concerns could pick up vote-by-mail ballots and turn them in by 7 p.m. EDT. A group of civils rights organizations, including the New Florida Majority, LatinoJustice and Dream Defenders, sued Lee and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in federal court Monday, seeking to extend vote-by-mail deadlines through March 27, to allow people concerned about going to precincts a chance to vote. WASHINGTON – Democratic primary voters in Florida, Illinois and Arizona found some confusion at polling places that moved or closed because of coronavirus, but voting advocates said Tuesday that turnout might still eclipse the 2016 primary. Alex Gulotta, Arizona state director of the advocacy group All Voting Is Local, said concerns about coronavirus prompted officials to close polling places, which confused voters about where to go. In Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, the number of polling places dropped from 240 to 151, but anyone who is registered could vote at any of them. But while in-person voting was running low at about 20% of expectations, more people voted already by mail than in 2016, Gulotta said. “We’ve had enormous turnout by mail,” he said. “Turnout has been very low today, but overall, voting is more than 2016.” Jay Young, executive director of Common Cause Illinois, said problems emerged early with election judges who didn’t show up and polling places closed. Poll workers complained about a lack of wipes or hand sanitizer, he said. “Here in Illinois, it’s been a hectic and trying day,” he said, with in-person turnout running about one-third the rate of previous primaries. Liza McClenaghan, board chair for Common Cause Florida, said a number of poll workers in Palm Beach County didn’t report to work Tuesday. Some had keys to polling places, which prevented them opening, and others had keys to equipment, which prevented using them, she said. The county invited voters to visit one of four election offices, or to mail in ballots. But McClenaghan said elderly voters have been asking where to vote as they discovered closed polling places and were suspicious of having mail-in ballots delivered by strangers. “We’ve had a dog’s breakfast about information for poll closings,” McClenaghan said. “We hope things improve shortly.” Karen Hobert Flynn, president of Common Cause, said the challenges in the primaries will give election officials an opportunity to find remedies such as allowing more mail-in voting by the November election. “Today we’re faced with a challenge unlike anything we’ve seen in our 50 years of advocacy, a global pandemic where all 50 states have now declared a state of emergency,” she said. WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. – Palm Beach County, Florida faced a shortage in poll workers Tuesday morning as Florida held its presidential primary amid the nation’s coronavirus pandemic. Some voters found closed doors when they arrived at their voting sites, The Palm Beach Post reported. Some locations opened late but others remained closed, prompting officials to allow voters pick up vote-by-mail ballots at any of the county’s election offices. Ahead of Election Day, around 800 poll workers notified Palm Beach elected officials they would not work because of concerns about the COVID-19 outbreak, leaving nearly 3,000 workers to cover Palm Beach County’s 454 voting sites. Penny Powell of West Palm Beach told The Post she went to her polling place, Pine Jog Environmental Center, to find it closed. She said a park worker sent her to the Supervisor of Elections\' main office, where she was able to vote. “They’re both close to each other so it wasn’t out of the way,” she said. “So I’m good with it.” She did not know why her location was not open. Former Vice President Joe Biden is heavily favored to defeat Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in Florida’s Democratic presidential primary. But turnout is a major wild card, particularly with the possibility it could disproportionately dissuade senior voters from the polls. Biden performs better among old voters while young voters overwhelmingly back Sanders. At one Palm Beach County location, the King’s Point clubhouse west of Delray Beach, only 32 people had voted as of noon. Poll workers there said they expected a low turnout because of the coronavirus. But at other locations, voters said they waited in line for nearly an hour. As coronavirus precautions, voters are told to space out six feet apart as they wait to vote. WASHINGTON – Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced Tuesday his state would postpone its primary, moving it from April 28 to June 2. The move comes as Arizona, Florida, and Illinois hold their Democratic presidential primary elections Tuesday. Ohio closed its polling places after Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, declared a ""health emergency."" ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at a unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said in a release late Monday.  The virus, which has been named COVID-19, already appears to have depressed turnout in morning voting in Chicago. The Chicago Board of Elections said there was ""extremely low turnout"" in morning voting. From 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. EDT, only 10,000 votes were cast, the Board said, as opposed to 30,000 votes that would be cast in a low turnout election.  Former Vice President Joe Biden currently leads the national delegate count with 898, whereas Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has 745 delegates. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, has two delegates.  Former Vice President Joe Biden is heavily favored to defeat Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders as Arizona Democrats head to the polls for the state’s primary election amid the global pandemic. Maricopa County election officials, in reaction to the coronavirus, closed 80 polling places and made the remaining 151 voting locations ""vote centers,” allowing voters to vote at any location, not just the one in their neighborhood.   Sanders visited Phoenix earlier this month to bolster his campaign. He is counting on the state\'s significant Latino population to provide a boost for him, but recent polling suggests he remains well behind here. --Ronald J.

        AnswerContent: '"Thomas Waerner mushes into Unalakleet, Alaska, on Sunday during the Iditarod. Photograph: Loren Holmes/AP An English-born musher from Norway running in only his second Iditarod has a commanding lead as mushers enter the final stretch of this year’s sled dog race across Alaska, one of the few US sports not canceled over fears of the new coronavirus. Thomas Waerner was the first musher to reach the checkpoint in White Mountain, Alaska, just after 5:30am on Tuesday. White Mountain is the second-to-last checkpoint, and where mushers must take a mandatory eight-hour rest before navigating the treacherous and windswept icy Bering Sea coastline the last 77mi (124km) to the finish line in Nome. Wearner noted that four-time champion Jeff Kijng was also set up well at this point of the race in 2014, until a blizzard caused King to scratch close to Nome. “It’s never over before it’s over, but it looks pretty good,” Waerner, 46, said in a video posted to the Iditarod website. GPS tracking on the Iditarod website showed the nearest musher to Waerner was three-time champion Mitch Seavey, about 30mi (48km) behind him on the trail to White Mountain. Chasing the leaders were Jessie Royer of Fairbanks – aiming to become the female winner since the late Susan Butcher in 1990 – Brent Sass of Eureka and Aaron Burmeister of Nome. He would become only the fourth non-American to win the race after four-time champion Martin Buser of Switzerland and the Norwegian mushers Robert Sørlie and Joar Leifseth Ulsom. Wearner, whose official bio states he was born in England and lives in Torpa, Norway, first ran the Iditarod in 2015, when he finished in 17th place and earned Rookie of the Year honors.

Photograph: Loren Holmes/AP The Iditarod began on 8 March just north of Anchorage for 57 mushers, the second smallest field in two decades. They crossed two mountain ranges and mushed on the frozen Yukon River before reaching the Bering Sea. Since the race started, nine mushers have withdrawn from the race. Fears over the new coronavirus prompted big changes along the trail for race officials. They asked fans not to fly to Nome for the finish after the city, like many in Alaska, closed public buildings. In some other villages, which serve as checkpoints along the nearly 1,000mi (1,600km) course, official check-in points were moved outside the communities to limit contact. In one case, the checkpoint was held on the Yukon River. An animal welfare group took credit for two sponsors with Alaska ties announcing they would drop sponsorship. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals claims more than 150 dogs have died horrible deaths running the Iditarod since it began in 1973. The Iditarod disputes that number but has declined to provide its own count despite numerous requests by the Associated Press. Alaska Airlines announced before the race started it would end its four-decade-long financial support, citing a change in the company’s corporate giving strategy. On Monday, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said its Anchorage Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram dealership would no longer sponsor the race. Peta pressures race sponsors to drop out, often conducting protests outside corporate headquarters, like it says it did in Seattle at the airline and in Detroit for the automaker. The Anchorage dealership was one of the Iditarod’s top-tier sponsors and has for 30 years provided a large chunk of the winner’s prize, a new pickup. Officials have not announced the amount of this year’s purse, but the cash prizes have shrunk the last few years. Seavey won $71,250 for winning the 2017 race, while 2019 champion Pete Kaiser only received $51,299. “This is a money-spending sport,” Waerner joked when accepting the $2,500 check from a sponsor Monday.

Photograph: Loren Holmes/AP An English-born musher from Norway running in only his second Iditarod has a commanding lead as mushers enter the final stretch of this year’s sled dog race across Alaska, one of the few US sports not canceled over fears of the new coronavirus. Thomas Waerner was the first musher to reach the checkpoint in White Mountain, Alaska, just after 5:30am on Tuesday. White Mountain is the second-to-last checkpoint, and where mushers must take a mandatory eight-hour rest before navigating the treacherous and windswept icy Bering Sea coastline the last 77mi (124km) to the finish line in Nome. Wearner noted that four-time champion Jeff Kijng was also set up well at this point of the race in 2014, until a blizzard caused King to scratch close to Nome. “It’s never over before it’s over, but it looks pretty good,” Waerner, 46, said in a video posted to the Iditarod website. GPS tracking on the Iditarod website showed the nearest musher to Waerner was three-time champion Mitch Seavey, about 30mi (48km) behind him on the trail to White Mountain. Chasing the leaders were Jessie Royer of Fairbanks – aiming to become the female winner since the late Susan Butcher in 1990 – Brent Sass of Eureka and Aaron Burmeister of Nome. He would become only the fourth non-American to win the race after four-time champion Martin Buser of Switzerland and the Norwegian mushers Robert Sørlie and Joar Leifseth Ulsom. Wearner, whose official bio states he was born in England and lives in Torpa, Norway, first ran the Iditarod in 2015, when he finished in 17th place and earned Rookie of the Year honors.

        ArticleContent: "\"SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un acknowledged that his country lacks modern medical facilities and called for urgent improvements, state media said Wednesday, in a rare assessment of the North's health care system that comes amid worries about the coronavirus in the impoverished country. Outside experts say a coronavirus epidemic in the North could be devastating due its chronic lack of medical supplies and outdated health care infrastructure. Kim’s comments were made during a ceremony Tuesday marking the start of construction on a new hospital. North Korea has engaged in an intense campaign to guard against the new virus, though it has steadfastly maintained that no one has been sickened, a claim many foreign experts doubt. During a groundbreaking ceremony for a “modern general hospital\"\" in Pyongyang, the capital, Kim said it’s “crucial” for the state’s efforts to be directed \"\"to prop up the field of public health,” according to the North's official Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA. It cited Kim as saying the construction must be completed before October’s 75th founding anniversary of the ruling Workers’ Party. Kim said the ruling party decided on building the hospital during a key party meeting in late December and was working to have it finished “in the shortest time.” In an unusual admission on a troubled state system, Kim also said, “Frankly speaking, our party ... criticized in a heart-aching manner the fact that there is not a modern medical and health care facility even in our capital city,” according to KCNA. Kim appears to be using the hospital construction to burnish his image as a leader caring about public livelihoods at a time when his country is grappling with international sanctions amid stalled nuclear diplomacy with the United States, said Ahn Kyung-su, head of the Seoul-based private Research Center of DPRK Health and Welfare. He said North Korea has several modern general hospitals in Pyongyang but an analysis of construction drawings for the new hospital shown in KCNA photos suggested it would be the most sophisticated hospital in North Korea when it’s built. In a report to the World Health Organization, North Korea said it had 135 general and other major hospitals throughout the country as of 2017, according to South Korea's Unification Ministry. Some observers said North Korea may have hurried the hospital's construction since China reported the first cases of the new disease in December. While the new coronavirus can be deadly, particularly for the elderly and people with other health problems, for most people it causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. Some feel no symptoms at all and the vast majority of people recover. Kim’s attendance at the hospital ceremony also confirmed that he returned to Pyongyang after supervising artillery firing exercises on North Korea's east coast. His visits to the rural coastal areas had prompted outside speculation that he may have been trying to avoid the virus. “North Korea clearly stated the date for the groundbreaking ceremony was March 17, and that clearly showed Chairman Kim Jong Un is back to Pyongyang and is governing state affairs normally,” said Kim Dong-yub, an analyst at Seoul's Institute for Far Eastern Studies. North Korea banned foreign tourists, delayed the school year and quarantined hundreds of foreigners and thousands of locals to avoid the virus that has spread worldwide. Last week, KCNA described authorities inspecting and disinfecting vehicles, vessels and goods at border areas and ports and said some imports remained sealed for 10 days before being handed over to recipients. Groups that monitor North Korea from South Korea, say the country has had cases of infection with the new coronavirus as well as fatalities. Some experts say the Kim government considers public disclosure of those cases harmful to its tight grip on power. The chief of the 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea said last week that he was fairly certain North Korea has not been spared from the virus. Army Gen. Robert Abrams noted that the North had halted military training for a month, essentially putting its troops in a lockdown, but has since resumed training exercises and flying. Earlier this month, Kim Jong Un sent a letter to South Korea’s president to express condolences over the soaring coronavirus outbreak in the South.

His visits to the rural coastal areas had prompted outside speculation that he may have been trying to avoid the virus. “North Korea clearly stated the date for the groundbreaking ceremony was March 17, and that clearly showed Chairman Kim Jong Un is back to Pyongyang and is governing state affairs normally,” said Kim Dong-yub, an analyst at Seoul's Institute for Far Eastern Studies. North Korea banned foreign tourists, delayed the school year and quarantined hundreds of foreigners and thousands of locals to avoid the virus that has spread worldwide. Last week, KCNA described authorities inspecting and disinfecting vehicles, vessels and goods at border areas and ports and said some imports remained sealed for 10 days before being handed over to recipients. Groups that monitor North Korea from South Korea, say the country has had cases of infection with the new coronavirus as well as fatalities. Some experts say the Kim government considers public disclosure of those cases harmful to its tight grip on power. The chief of the 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea said last week that he was fairly certain North Korea has not been spared from the virus. Army Gen. Robert Abrams noted that the North had halted military training for a month, essentially putting its troops in a lockdown, but has since resumed training exercises and flying. Earlier this month, Kim Jong Un sent a letter to South Korea’s president to express condolences over the soaring coronavirus outbreak in the South. Kim’s letter was delivered a day after his powerful younger sister insulted and criticized Seoul. Some experts speculated that the development suggested that Kim was aiming to throw South Korea off balance before asking for coronavirus-related aid items such as test kits. About 290 foreigners who were quarantined in North Korea have been released, including some diplomats who were flown to Vladivostok, Russia, on a special North Korean flight. It wasn't immediately known whether North Korea plans another flight.

        ArticleContent: '"Joe Biden swept all three primaries on Tuesday night in Arizona, Florida and Illinois, CBS News projects. The contests took place amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis that led Ohio officials to postpone their primary, which had also been scheduled for Tuesday. In remarks after his early win in Florida, Biden, speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, said his campaign appeared to have had a ""very good night,"" but he also spoke about the coronavirus crisis. He told Americans that ""it\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy."" Bernie Sanders gave remarks via livestream earlier in the night. He focused mainly on the coronavirus crisis and highlighted unity. Tuesday\'s lopsided results will expand the divide in delegates between Biden and Sanders. It\'s unclear when the next primary contests will be held. Georgia, which had been set to vote on March 24, has postponed its primary, as did Louisiana, which was scheduled to go to the polls on April 4. As of 12 a.m. ET on Wednesday, Biden had increased his lead to 291 delegates. Biden now has 1,093 delegates to Sanders\' 802. To get the nomination, the Democratic candidate will need 1,991 delegates. According to CBS News primary polling in Arizona, the most important candidate quality for voters was being able to unite the country. Of those voters, 65% said they voted for Biden, while just 16% went for Sanders. The poll was mostly of voters who already voted by mail and includes those who said they were likely to show up at polls today. Like Florida and Illinois voters, 69% of Arizona voters saw Biden as the candidate with the best chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to 26% who believed the same of Sanders. Biden was also seen as the candidate trusted more to handle a major crisis. Biden led among white voters by 51% to 32%. Hispanic voters were more evenly divided: Biden 45% to Sanders 44%. CBS News projects the former vice president wins the Arizona primary, finalizing Biden\'s sweep of the three states that voted. Sixty-seven pledged delegates are up for grabs in Arizona. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose cheered the decision to postpone the state\'s primary election until June 2, saying it ""saved Ohio lives."" ""By preventing Ohioans from going to polling locations, we averted a situation which would have gone against the most recent scientific evidence available and could have dangerously advanced the spread of coronavirus across Ohio,"" the two said in a joining statement. ""It is abundantly clear that it would have been impossible to carry out a fair, accessible, and safe election today."" DeWine and LaRose stressed that Ohio voters should have a ""significant"" amount of time to cast mail-in absentee ballots and also vote in-person. Less than 12 hours before the polls were set to open in Ohio, DeWine announced that Dr. Amy Acton, director of the Ohio Department of Health, would be issuing an order to close polls ""to avoid the imminent threat with the high probability of widespread exposure to COVID-19."" As of 11 p.m. ET, Biden is leading in every county in Florida. Although Hillary Clinton won the primary in 2016, Sanders won nine counties in the northern part of the state in that contest. The Arizona secretary of state has revealed that personal information related to some protected voters was erroneously included in reports generated from the state\'s voter registration database. Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said in a statement that the error was not the result of a security breach or vulnerability. Hobbs said her office was notified from a county official that an early ballot report they compiled included ""protected voters,"" or those whose information is protected due to their jobs or if they were victims of certain crimes. Seventy-eight names were mistakenly included in the reports, the secretary of state\'s office said, and the office has asked county officials to contact those who were directly impacted. The early ballot reports are produced using data from the state\'s voter registration database, and the reports are provided by counties to political parties during elections. Hobb\'s office said the process for producing reports from the voter registration database has also been updated to prevent future errors. Biden celebrated his early wins in Illinois and Florida with a solemn address to supporters calling for the country to come together in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, while also thanking Bernie Sanders and his supporters for the ""remarkable passion"" they have brought to the Democratic race. Speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, with a backdrop of black cloth and flanked by two American flags, Biden remarked that his campaign ""has had a very good night"" and is moving closer to securing the Democratic presidential nomination. He also thanked election officials and poll workers in the three states with in-person voting for ensuring people could cast their ballots while also remaining safe. ""It\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy,"" he said. Biden said that his campaign is building a broad coalition that includes support from African-Americans, the Latino community, labor, firefighters, teachers, suburban women and others. ""We\'re doing it with a common vision,"" he said, adding that he and Sanders share that vision. The former vice president also thanked Sanders and his supporters for bringing ""remarkable passion and tenacity"" to issues like healthcare, income inequality and climate change, and delivered a message directly to young Sanders supporters. ""To young votes who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you, I know what\'s at stake. I know what we have to do,"" he said. ""Our goal as a campaign and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party and to unify the nation."" Biden also praised Americans for altering their lives as public health officials rush to limit the spread of the coronavirus, saying that Americans are ""ordinary people doing extraordinary things when the need arises and today we are moving quickly to adapt our routines to meet this challenge."" ""It\'s in moments like these we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans,"" Biden said. ""The coronavirus doesn\'t care if you\'re a Democrat or Republican. It will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender or your zip code. It will touch people in positions of power as well as the most vulnerable people in our society. We\'re all in this together."" A large number of likely voters in Illinois, 87%, said they were concerned about coronavirus, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to the primary. Biden received the support of likely voters concerned about the coronavirus by about 2-to-1. Similar percentages of likely voters are worried about the direction of the nation\'s economy in 2021, and Biden received their support by a similar margin. Sixty-four percent of likely voters in the Illinois primary picked Biden over Sanders as the person they would trust more to handle a major crisis. Likely primary voters in Illinois said beating President Trump was more important to them than having a candidate who agreed with them on the issues, and 69% said Biden would have the better chance to defeat the incumbent president in November. Polling shows Biden with a commanding lead among black likely voters – getting 70% of those polled – but he also received a majority vote of white likely voters as well, securing the support of both whites with and without college degrees. He received the support of over half of men and nearly two-thirds of women. The generational divide seen throughout this election cycle was also apparent in Illinois, with Sanders taking the vast majority of likely voters under 45, and Biden getting the strong support among older voters. But older likely voters significantly outnumbered their younger counterparts: more than six in ten likely voters were over the age of 45. And while Sanders maintains strong support of likely voters who say they are very liberal – getting nearly two-thirds support among this group – they made up just over a quarter of those polled. Biden garnered strong support among likely voters who said they were ""somewhat liberal"", and did particularly well among moderates. CBS News estimates Illinois leans toward Biden. At the moment, Chicago looks to be very close between Biden and Sanders, but many more votes are expected to be counted. The current delegate allocation in Illinois has Biden with 33 delegates and Sanders with 21. There are 155 total delegates at stake in Illinois. Following wins in the Republican primaries in Illinois and Florida, President Trump has secured the delegates needed to win the Republican presidential nomination, CBS News projects. President Trump has clinched the Republican nomination.https://t.co/E3KhCZjESV pic.twitter.com/YNT7WliBd0 — CBS News (@CBSNews) March 18, 2020 Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel offered congratulations to Mr. Trump for ""officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for president."" Congratulations to Donald J. Trump on officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for President! His home state of Florida just delivered him the delegates he needed. Our party is united, our grassroots movement is fired up, and we are ready for FOUR MORE YEARS! pic.twitter.com/B4X9IaQp7f — Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) March 18, 2020 Mr. Trump had several early challengers for the Republican nomination, though most dropped out of the race. Only former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld remains in the race. Most likely voters in Florida said electability was a priority for them going into the primary, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to March 17. Seventy-three percent of likely voters also think Biden would have a good chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to just 21% who picked Sanders. Voters over age 45 were more likely to say they support Biden. Those who want the next president to return to Obama policies instead of more liberal policies said they would vote for Biden. Nearly half of Florida likely voters said Sanders\' issue positions were too liberal, but most said Biden\'s issue positions were about right. Florida likely voters said they trusted Biden over Sanders by a wide margin — 59% to 37% — to handle Social Security. anders addressed supporters in a livestreamed speech after polls closed in most of Florida and called for the country to come together as local, state and federal officials respond to the coronavirus. ""I think the main point to be made tonight is that in this moment of crisis, it is imperative that we stand together, understand that right now throughout this country, there are so many of our people wondering what\'s going to happen to me tomorrow?"" Sanders said. He added that ""this is a moment that we have got to be working together."" Sanders laid out a series of proposals he said he plans to present to Democratic leadership and said an adequate response will require an ""unprecedented"" amount of money."" Sanders estimated the price tag will top $2 trillion. The plans put forth by Sanders to bolster the response to the coronavirus include allowing Medicare to cover all medical bills during the public health crisis; increasing test kits for the coronavirus and the speed at which tests are processed; activating the National Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other military resources to help expand healthcare capacity; and using emergency authority to scale up production in the U.S. of critical supplies and protective equipment. Sanders also suggested a number of measures to mitigate the economic impacts for American workers and their families, including providing a $2,000 monthly cash payment to every household for the duration of the crisis, expanding Meals on Wheels and food stamps and placing a moratorium on evictions, foreclosures and utility shutoffs. ""We must make certain that the government is getting this money into the hands of working families and the most vulnerable as quickly as possible,"" he said. Sanders said the economic crisis should not be ""another money-making opportunity"" for large corporations and Wall Street. ""We\'ve got some major crisis, but I have the strong belief that if we work together, if we do not turn to fear and panic, but if we understand that the way we solve this is by going forward as one people, remembering those who are hurting tonight and will be hurting in the future,"" he said. ""This is the richest country in the history world. This is a country with unbelievable energy, with unbelievable talent, with incredible resources. We can do it. We can address this crisis, we can minimize the pain and let us do just that."" CBS News projects Biden will win Florida, the biggest prize in Tuesday\'s primaries with 219 pledged delegates. Florida has a large Hispanic population, and Biden has previously struggled to gain support from Hispanic voters in states which have already held primaries, like Nevada. The delegate allocation at poll closing in Florida was 100 delegates for Biden, and 27 for Sanders, according to CBS News\' analysis. All polls are now closed in Florida and in Illinois, after an election day marked by fears about the spread of the coronavirus. Polls close in Arizona at 10 p.m. ET. The Ohio primary has been pushed back until June 2. Sanders will livestream remarks about the coronavirus crisis at 7:15 p.m., shortly after polls close in Florida. The speech will address how the ""response to the outbreak should put working families and the most vulnerable first,"" according to a press release from the campaign. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democrats said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Biden and Sanders have made remarks outlining their plans to respond to the crisis. The Florida Democratic Party said the number of Democrats who have voted early in person and by mail has exceeded turnout in the primaries in 2016. According to the state party, 141,560 more Democrats voted by mail this year than they did in the last presidential primary. Additionally, 74,031 more Democrats voted early in person this year than in 2016. The Florida Democratic Party also said it enrolled nearly 500,000 new Democrats into vote-by-mail in 2018. The party said that the coronavirus pandemic, which has impacted voting in states holding their contests today, demonstrates the need for the government to revamp voting methods. As the country deals with a health care crisis, the issue of health care remains on voters\' minds. In Arizona, Florida, and Illinois, voters picked health care as the issue that would be most important in determining their vote, according to CBS News primary polls. The second most important issue among voters in each of the three states was income inequality, followed by climate change and race relations. Likely Democratic voters in Illinois said they are also worried about the economy, primary polls show. More than eight in 10 are least somewhat concerned about the national economy over the next year. In the three states where voters will head to the polls Tuesday, most said they prefer the Democratic nominee be someone who can beat Trump — at least six in 10 in each state— over someone they agree with on major issues, according to CBS News primary polls. As has been the case throughout this campaign, there are high levels of dissatisfaction toward the Trump administration among the Democratic primary electorate. Large majorities of likely voters in Florida and Illinois and those who voted by mail in Arizona said they feel angry about the Trump administration. Among likely Democratic voters in Illinois, more Sanders supporters said they would be unhappy about Biden being the nominee than Biden supporters would be if Sanders became the nominee, according to primary polls. Fifty-four percent of Sanders supporters would be dissatisfied or upset if Biden won the nomination, compared to 37% of Biden backers who would feel that way if Sanders became the nominee. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democratic voters said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Among those polled in Florida, 71% said they trusted Biden more, compared to 23% who said Sanders is the candidate they trust to handle a major crisis. In Illinois, 64% of Democratic voters selected Biden while 31% said Sanders is more trusted, and in Arizona, 63% said they trust Biden more to handle a major crisis compared to 31%, who pointed to Sanders. The Democratic National Committee is calling on states that haven\'t yet held their primaries to vote by mail, as coronavirus threatens future primaries. ""The simplest tool is vote by mail, which is already in use in a number of states and should be made available to all registered voters. States using vote by mail should proactively mail ballots to registered voters, where feasible, and should count all ballots as long as they are postmarked by the date of the primary,"" DNC chair Tom Perez said in a statement on Wednesday. Where in-person voting can take place in accordance with health guidelines, states should expand the days and hours of early voting to cut down on lines, Perez added. According to CBS News primary polls, nearly all likely voters in Illinois expressed at least some concern about the effects of the coronavirus, including more than half who said they are very concerned about it. Most likely voters of all ages in Illinois said they are concerned, but older voters are particularly so: 62% of voters ages 45 and over say they are very concerned, compared to 38% of younger voters. Women (59%) were also more likely than men (46%) to be very concerned. Some voters, meanwhile, said the coronavirus could change their decision to vote. In Florida, among those who said they would definitely vote and planned to do so in person on Election Day, 15% said it was very or somewhat likely that they could change their decision to vote. In Illinois, that figure was 9%, according to primary polls. The Biden campaign is optimistic it will walk away from Tuesday\'s primaries with a wider delegate lead than it had going into the contests despite the challenges to voter turnout raised because of the coronavirus. ""It would take a drastic, historically-incomparable swing for Senator Sanders to win more delegates than Biden today or to close the delegate differential,"" the campaign said in a memo released Tuesday. Heading into the four primaries held on Tuesday, Biden led Sanders by more than 100 delegates. The former vice president\'s campaign also noted that while fewer people may head to the polls on Election Day because of the coronavirus, it expects overall turnout to match that of past elections. ""While voter turnout on Election Day itself may be lower due to COVID-19 concerns, we believe that, with early vote and vote by mail, overall turnout will be roughly on pace for 2016 in Arizona and Florida and roughly on pace for 2018 in Illinois, and that voter turnout in all three states will reflect the population at large,"" the campaign said in the memo. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, on Tuesday defended the decision to keep the polls open despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. ""There are people out there today who want to say, \'Oh, it\'s a crisis, bend the rules and overstep your authority,\'"" Pritzker said. ""Let me tell you this, It is exactly in times like these, when the constitutional boundaries of our democracy should be respected above all else. And if people want to criticize me for that, well, go ahead. I\'ll wear it like a badge of honor."" Earlier Tuesday, Chicago Board of Elections spokesman Jim Allen said he urged Pritzker to prohibit voting in person and go fully vote-by-mail. Allen later apologized for the remarks. The Chicago Board of Elections said they said they\'ve had to move in total 200 precincts, with some locations in the city dropping out as soon as this morning (these cases were immediately moved to a new location). In Chicago, 126,499 votes have been cast through 2 p.m. ET, with a surge after the first two hours. Biden tweeted a reminder about polls being open in Arizona, Florida and Illinois. ""I encourage folks to vote by mail or curbside vote if you can,"" Biden wrote. ""If you vote in person, please wash your hands, don\'t touch your face, and stay 6\' from others in line."" Maryland Governor Larry Hogan announced at a press conference on Tuesday morning that the state will move its primary from April 28 until June 2. The state Board of Elections issued a statement shortly after that ""fully supports"" Hogan\'s decision. The decision follows similar action in Georgia, Kentucky and Louisiana. In a last-minute move on Monday, Ohio postponed its primary. The Ohio State Supreme Court denied a challenge to Ohio\'s primary delay filed by Wood County judicial candidate Corey Speweik, who was fighting the state of Ohio\'s decision to shut down Tuesday\'s primary and postpone voting until June over concern about the spread of the coronavirus. The process leading up to the delay was chaotic. With less than 12 hours to go before polls were scheduled to open in Ohio for the state\'s presidential primary election, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, announced polls would remain closed Tuesday amid concerns over the coronavirus. The decision came just hours after a Franklin County judge denied a request backed by the governor and secretary of state to delay the election. The Ohio Democratic Party said in a statement Tuesday that although voting did not seem feasible, it hoped the primary would be rescheduled for earlier than June 2. ""Given the chaos, confusion and mixed messages of the past 24 hours, it\'s clearly impossible for in-person voting to move forward today in Ohio,"" the party said in a statement. ""The Ohio Democratic Party strongly supports concluding the primary election earlier than June 2. Extending for that long is highly problematic for any number for reasons, and it is not at all clear that in-person voting will be possible on that date anyway,"" the statement continued. At a news conference Monday, in response to a question about the possible impact of the coronavirus outbreak, President Trump said delaying elections would be ""not a very good thing."" ""I\'d leave that up to the states,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Postponing elections is not a very good thing … I think postponing is unnecessary."" A poll by Monmouth University released on Monday showed Biden with a double-digit advantage over Sanders in Arizona. Among voters likely to participate in the primary, Biden was supported by 51% to Sanders\' 31%. Sanders leads among Latino voters by seven points, and among voters under 50 years old by wide margins. But this is more than offset by Biden\'s strong advantage among larger voter blocs, including white voters and those aged 50 and over. In head-to-head matchups with the president, Biden had a small edge Mr. Trump, but the president was virtually tied with Sanders. Although Arizona has long been a solid red state, it could be a battleground this November. Mr. Trump only won the state by 4 points against Hillary Clinton in 2016. In the Senate race, Democrat Mark Kelly had a 6-point edge in the poll over incumbent Martha McSally. "',

Seventy-eight names were mistakenly included in the reports, the secretary of state\'s office said, and the office has asked county officials to contact those who were directly impacted. The early ballot reports are produced using data from the state\'s voter registration database, and the reports are provided by counties to political parties during elections. Hobb\'s office said the process for producing reports from the voter registration database has also been updated to prevent future errors. Biden celebrated his early wins in Illinois and Florida with a solemn address to supporters calling for the country to come together in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, while also thanking Bernie Sanders and his supporters for the ""remarkable passion"" they have brought to the Democratic race. Speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, with a backdrop of black cloth and flanked by two American flags, Biden remarked that his campaign ""has had a very good night"" and is moving closer to securing the Democratic presidential nomination. He also thanked election officials and poll workers in the three states with in-person voting for ensuring people could cast their ballots while also remaining safe. ""It\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy,"" he said. Biden said that his campaign is building a broad coalition that includes support from African-Americans, the Latino community, labor, firefighters, teachers, suburban women and others. ""We\'re doing it with a common vision,"" he said, adding that he and Sanders share that vision. The former vice president also thanked Sanders and his supporters for bringing ""remarkable passion and tenacity"" to issues like healthcare, income inequality and climate change, and delivered a message directly to young Sanders supporters. ""To young votes who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you, I know what\'s at stake. I know what we have to do,"" he said. ""Our goal as a campaign and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party and to unify the nation."" Biden also praised Americans for altering their lives as public health officials rush to limit the spread of the coronavirus, saying that Americans are ""ordinary people doing extraordinary things when the need arises and today we are moving quickly to adapt our routines to meet this challenge."" ""It\'s in moments like these we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans,"" Biden said. ""The coronavirus doesn\'t care if you\'re a Democrat or Republican. It will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender or your zip code. It will touch people in positions of power as well as the most vulnerable people in our society. We\'re all in this together."" A large number of likely voters in Illinois, 87%, said they were concerned about coronavirus, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to the primary. Biden received the support of likely voters concerned about the coronavirus by about 2-to-1. Similar percentages of likely voters are worried about the direction of the nation\'s economy in 2021, and Biden received their support by a similar margin. Sixty-four percent of likely voters in the Illinois primary picked Biden over Sanders as the person they would trust more to handle a major crisis. Likely primary voters in Illinois said beating President Trump was more important to them than having a candidate who agreed with them on the issues, and 69% said Biden would have the better chance to defeat the incumbent president in November. Polling shows Biden with a commanding lead among black likely voters – getting 70% of those polled – but he also received a majority vote of white likely voters as well, securing the support of both whites with and without college degrees. He received the support of over half of men and nearly two-thirds of women. The generational divide seen throughout this election cycle was also apparent in Illinois, with Sanders taking the vast majority of likely voters under 45, and Biden getting the strong support among older voters. But older likely voters significantly outnumbered their younger counterparts: more than six in ten likely voters were over the age of 45. And while Sanders maintains strong support of likely voters who say they are very liberal – getting nearly two-thirds support among this group – they made up just over a quarter of those polled. Biden garnered strong support among likely voters who said they were ""somewhat liberal"", and did particularly well among moderates. CBS News estimates Illinois leans toward Biden. At the moment, Chicago looks to be very close between Biden and Sanders, but many more votes are expected to be counted. The current delegate allocation in Illinois has Biden with 33 delegates and Sanders with 21. There are 155 total delegates at stake in Illinois. Following wins in the Republican primaries in Illinois and Florida, President Trump has secured the delegates needed to win the Republican presidential nomination, CBS News projects.

Seventy-three percent of likely voters also think Biden would have a good chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to just 21% who picked Sanders. Voters over age 45 were more likely to say they support Biden. Those who want the next president to return to Obama policies instead of more liberal policies said they would vote for Biden. Nearly half of Florida likely voters said Sanders\' issue positions were too liberal, but most said Biden\'s issue positions were about right. Florida likely voters said they trusted Biden over Sanders by a wide margin — 59% to 37% — to handle Social Security. anders addressed supporters in a livestreamed speech after polls closed in most of Florida and called for the country to come together as local, state and federal officials respond to the coronavirus. ""I think the main point to be made tonight is that in this moment of crisis, it is imperative that we stand together, understand that right now throughout this country, there are so many of our people wondering what\'s going to happen to me tomorrow?"" Sanders said. He added that ""this is a moment that we have got to be working together."" Sanders laid out a series of proposals he said he plans to present to Democratic leadership and said an adequate response will require an ""unprecedented"" amount of money."" Sanders estimated the price tag will top $2 trillion. The plans put forth by Sanders to bolster the response to the coronavirus include allowing Medicare to cover all medical bills during the public health crisis; increasing test kits for the coronavirus and the speed at which tests are processed; activating the National Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other military resources to help expand healthcare capacity; and using emergency authority to scale up production in the U.S. of critical supplies and protective equipment. Sanders also suggested a number of measures to mitigate the economic impacts for American workers and their families, including providing a $2,000 monthly cash payment to every household for the duration of the crisis, expanding Meals on Wheels and food stamps and placing a moratorium on evictions, foreclosures and utility shutoffs. ""We must make certain that the government is getting this money into the hands of working families and the most vulnerable as quickly as possible,"" he said. Sanders said the economic crisis should not be ""another money-making opportunity"" for large corporations and Wall Street. ""We\'ve got some major crisis, but I have the strong belief that if we work together, if we do not turn to fear and panic, but if we understand that the way we solve this is by going forward as one people, remembering those who are hurting tonight and will be hurting in the future,"" he said. ""This is the richest country in the history world. This is a country with unbelievable energy, with unbelievable talent, with incredible resources. We can do it. We can address this crisis, we can minimize the pain and let us do just that."" CBS News projects Biden will win Florida, the biggest prize in Tuesday\'s primaries with 219 pledged delegates. Florida has a large Hispanic population, and Biden has previously struggled to gain support from Hispanic voters in states which have already held primaries, like Nevada. The delegate allocation at poll closing in Florida was 100 delegates for Biden, and 27 for Sanders, according to CBS News\' analysis. All polls are now closed in Florida and in Illinois, after an election day marked by fears about the spread of the coronavirus. Polls close in Arizona at 10 p.m. ET. The Ohio primary has been pushed back until June 2. Sanders will livestream remarks about the coronavirus crisis at 7:15 p.m., shortly after polls close in Florida. The speech will address how the ""response to the outbreak should put working families and the most vulnerable first,"" according to a press release from the campaign. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democrats said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Biden and Sanders have made remarks outlining their plans to respond to the crisis. The Florida Democratic Party said the number of Democrats who have voted early in person and by mail has exceeded turnout in the primaries in 2016. According to the state party, 141,560 more Democrats voted by mail this year than they did in the last presidential primary. Additionally, 74,031 more Democrats voted early in person this year than in 2016. The Florida Democratic Party also said it enrolled nearly 500,000 new Democrats into vote-by-mail in 2018. The party said that the coronavirus pandemic, which has impacted voting in states holding their contests today, demonstrates the need for the government to revamp voting methods. As the country deals with a health care crisis, the issue of health care remains on voters\' minds. In Arizona, Florida, and Illinois, voters picked health care as the issue that would be most important in determining their vote, according to CBS News primary polls. The second most important issue among voters in each of the three states was income inequality, followed by climate change and race relations. Likely Democratic voters in Illinois said they are also worried about the economy, primary polls show. More than eight in 10 are least somewhat concerned about the national economy over the next year. In the three states where voters will head to the polls Tuesday, most said they prefer the Democratic nominee be someone who can beat Trump — at least six in 10 in each state— over someone they agree with on major issues, according to CBS News primary polls. As has been the case throughout this campaign, there are high levels of dissatisfaction toward the Trump administration among the Democratic primary electorate. Large majorities of likely voters in Florida and Illinois and those who voted by mail in Arizona said they feel angry about the Trump administration. Among likely Democratic voters in Illinois, more Sanders supporters said they would be unhappy about Biden being the nominee than Biden supporters would be if Sanders became the nominee, according to primary polls. Fifty-four percent of Sanders supporters would be dissatisfied or upset if Biden won the nomination, compared to 37% of Biden backers who would feel that way if Sanders became the nominee. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democratic voters said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Among those polled in Florida, 71% said they trusted Biden more, compared to 23% who said Sanders is the candidate they trust to handle a major crisis. In Illinois, 64% of Democratic voters selected Biden while 31% said Sanders is more trusted, and in Arizona, 63% said they trust Biden more to handle a major crisis compared to 31%, who pointed to Sanders. The Democratic National Committee is calling on states that haven\'t yet held their primaries to vote by mail, as coronavirus threatens future primaries. ""The simplest tool is vote by mail, which is already in use in a number of states and should be made available to all registered voters. States using vote by mail should proactively mail ballots to registered voters, where feasible, and should count all ballots as long as they are postmarked by the date of the primary,"" DNC chair Tom Perez said in a statement on Wednesday. Where in-person voting can take place in accordance with health guidelines, states should expand the days and hours of early voting to cut down on lines, Perez added. According to CBS News primary polls, nearly all likely voters in Illinois expressed at least some concern about the effects of the coronavirus, including more than half who said they are very concerned about it. Most likely voters of all ages in Illinois said they are concerned, but older voters are particularly so: 62% of voters ages 45 and over say they are very concerned, compared to 38% of younger voters. Women (59%) were also more likely than men (46%) to be very concerned. Some voters, meanwhile, said the coronavirus could change their decision to vote. In Florida, among those who said they would definitely vote and planned to do so in person on Election Day, 15% said it was very or somewhat likely that they could change their decision to vote. In Illinois, that figure was 9%, according to primary polls. The Biden campaign is optimistic it will walk away from Tuesday\'s primaries with a wider delegate lead than it had going into the contests despite the challenges to voter turnout raised because of the coronavirus. ""It would take a drastic, historically-incomparable swing for Senator Sanders to win more delegates than Biden today or to close the delegate differential,"" the campaign said in a memo released Tuesday. Heading into the four primaries held on Tuesday, Biden led Sanders by more than 100 delegates. The former vice president\'s campaign also noted that while fewer people may head to the polls on Election Day because of the coronavirus, it expects overall turnout to match that of past elections. ""While voter turnout on Election Day itself may be lower due to COVID-19 concerns, we believe that, with early vote and vote by mail, overall turnout will be roughly on pace for 2016 in Arizona and Florida and roughly on pace for 2018 in Illinois, and that voter turnout in all three states will reflect the population at large,"" the campaign said in the memo. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, on Tuesday defended the decision to keep the polls open despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. ""There are people out there today who want to say, \'Oh, it\'s a crisis, bend the rules and overstep your authority,\'"" Pritzker said. ""Let me tell you this, It is exactly in times like these, when the constitutional boundaries of our democracy should be respected above all else. And if people want to criticize me for that, well, go ahead. I\'ll wear it like a badge of honor."" Earlier Tuesday, Chicago Board of Elections spokesman Jim Allen said he urged Pritzker to prohibit voting in person and go fully vote-by-mail. Allen later apologized for the remarks. The Chicago Board of Elections said they said they\'ve had to move in total 200 precincts, with some locations in the city dropping out as soon as this morning (these cases were immediately moved to a new location). In Chicago, 126,499 votes have been cast through 2 p.m. ET, with a surge after the first two hours. Biden tweeted a reminder about polls being open in Arizona, Florida and Illinois. ""I encourage folks to vote by mail or curbside vote if you can,"" Biden wrote. ""If you vote in person, please wash your hands, don\'t touch your face, and stay 6\' from others in line."" Maryland Governor Larry Hogan announced at a press conference on Tuesday morning that the state will move its primary from April 28 until June 2. The state Board of Elections issued a statement shortly after that ""fully supports"" Hogan\'s decision. The decision follows similar action in Georgia, Kentucky and Louisiana. In a last-minute move on Monday, Ohio postponed its primary. The Ohio State Supreme Court denied a challenge to Ohio\'s primary delay filed by Wood County judicial candidate Corey Speweik, who was fighting the state of Ohio\'s decision to shut down Tuesday\'s primary and postpone voting until June over concern about the spread of the coronavirus. The process leading up to the delay was chaotic. With less than 12 hours to go before polls were scheduled to open in Ohio for the state\'s presidential primary election, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, announced polls would remain closed Tuesday amid concerns over the coronavirus. The decision came just hours after a Franklin County judge denied a request backed by the governor and secretary of state to delay the election. The Ohio Democratic Party said in a statement Tuesday that although voting did not seem feasible, it hoped the primary would be rescheduled for earlier than June 2. ""Given the chaos, confusion and mixed messages of the past 24 hours, it\'s clearly impossible for in-person voting to move forward today in Ohio,"" the party said in a statement. ""The Ohio Democratic Party strongly supports concluding the primary election earlier than June 2. Extending for that long is highly problematic for any number for reasons, and it is not at all clear that in-person voting will be possible on that date anyway,"" the statement continued. At a news conference Monday, in response to a question about the possible impact of the coronavirus outbreak, President Trump said delaying elections would be ""not a very good thing."" ""I\'d leave that up to the states,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Postponing elections is not a very good thing … I think postponing is unnecessary."" A poll by Monmouth University released on Monday showed Biden with a double-digit advantage over Sanders in Arizona. Among voters likely to participate in the primary, Biden was supported by 51% to Sanders\' 31%. Sanders leads among Latino voters by seven points, and among voters under 50 years old by wide margins. But this is more than offset by Biden\'s strong advantage among larger voter blocs, including white voters and those aged 50 and over. In head-to-head matchups with the president, Biden had a small edge Mr. Trump, but the president was virtually tied with Sanders. Although Arizona has long been a solid red state, it could be a battleground this November. Mr. Trump only won the state by 4 points against Hillary Clinton in 2016. In the Senate race, Democrat Mark Kelly had a 6-point edge in the poll over incumbent Martha McSally. "',

        ArticleContent: '"Joe Biden swept all three primaries on Tuesday night in Arizona, Florida and Illinois, CBS News projects. The contests took place amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis that led Ohio officials to postpone their primary, which had also been scheduled for Tuesday. In remarks after his early win in Florida, Biden, speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, said his campaign appeared to have had a ""very good night,"" but he also spoke about the coronavirus crisis. He told Americans that ""it\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy."" Bernie Sanders gave remarks via livestream earlier in the night. He focused mainly on the coronavirus crisis and highlighted unity. Tuesday\'s lopsided results will expand the divide in delegates between Biden and Sanders. It\'s unclear when the next primary contests will be held. Georgia, which had been set to vote on March 24, has postponed its primary, as did Louisiana, which was scheduled to go to the polls on April 4. As of 12 a.m. ET on Wednesday, Biden had increased his lead to 291 delegates. Biden now has 1,093 delegates to Sanders\' 802. To get the nomination, the Democratic candidate will need 1,991 delegates. According to CBS News primary polling in Arizona, the most important candidate quality for voters was being able to unite the country. Of those voters, 65% said they voted for Biden, while just 16% went for Sanders. The poll was mostly of voters who already voted by mail and includes those who said they were likely to show up at polls today. Like Florida and Illinois voters, 69% of Arizona voters saw Biden as the candidate with the best chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to 26% who believed the same of Sanders. Biden was also seen as the candidate trusted more to handle a major crisis. Biden led among white voters by 51% to 32%. Hispanic voters were more evenly divided: Biden 45% to Sanders 44%. CBS News projects the former vice president wins the Arizona primary, finalizing Biden\'s sweep of the three states that voted. Sixty-seven pledged delegates are up for grabs in Arizona. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose cheered the decision to postpone the state\'s primary election until June 2, saying it ""saved Ohio lives."" ""By preventing Ohioans from going to polling locations, we averted a situation which would have gone against the most recent scientific evidence available and could have dangerously advanced the spread of coronavirus across Ohio,"" the two said in a joining statement. ""It is abundantly clear that it would have been impossible to carry out a fair, accessible, and safe election today."" DeWine and LaRose stressed that Ohio voters should have a ""significant"" amount of time to cast mail-in absentee ballots and also vote in-person. Less than 12 hours before the polls were set to open in Ohio, DeWine announced that Dr. Amy Acton, director of the Ohio Department of Health, would be issuing an order to close polls ""to avoid the imminent threat with the high probability of widespread exposure to COVID-19."" As of 11 p.m. ET, Biden is leading in every county in Florida. Although Hillary Clinton won the primary in 2016, Sanders won nine counties in the northern part of the state in that contest. The Arizona secretary of state has revealed that personal information related to some protected voters was erroneously included in reports generated from the state\'s voter registration database. Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said in a statement that the error was not the result of a security breach or vulnerability. Hobbs said her office was notified from a county official that an early ballot report they compiled included ""protected voters,"" or those whose information is protected due to their jobs or if they were victims of certain crimes.

CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democrats said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Biden and Sanders have made remarks outlining their plans to respond to the crisis. The Florida Democratic Party said the number of Democrats who have voted early in person and by mail has exceeded turnout in the primaries in 2016. According to the state party, 141,560 more Democrats voted by mail this year than they did in the last presidential primary. Additionally, 74,031 more Democrats voted early in person this year than in 2016. The Florida Democratic Party also said it enrolled nearly 500,000 new Democrats into vote-by-mail in 2018. The party said that the coronavirus pandemic, which has impacted voting in states holding their contests today, demonstrates the need for the government to revamp voting methods. As the country deals with a health care crisis, the issue of health care remains on voters\' minds. In Arizona, Florida, and Illinois, voters picked health care as the issue that would be most important in determining their vote, according to CBS News primary polls. The second most important issue among voters in each of the three states was income inequality, followed by climate change and race relations. Likely Democratic voters in Illinois said they are also worried about the economy, primary polls show. More than eight in 10 are least somewhat concerned about the national economy over the next year. In the three states where voters will head to the polls Tuesday, most said they prefer the Democratic nominee be someone who can beat Trump — at least six in 10 in each state— over someone they agree with on major issues, according to CBS News primary polls. As has been the case throughout this campaign, there are high levels of dissatisfaction toward the Trump administration among the Democratic primary electorate. Large majorities of likely voters in Florida and Illinois and those who voted by mail in Arizona said they feel angry about the Trump administration. Among likely Democratic voters in Illinois, more Sanders supporters said they would be unhappy about Biden being the nominee than Biden supporters would be if Sanders became the nominee, according to primary polls. Fifty-four percent of Sanders supporters would be dissatisfied or upset if Biden won the nomination, compared to 37% of Biden backers who would feel that way if Sanders became the nominee. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democratic voters said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Among those polled in Florida, 71% said they trusted Biden more, compared to 23% who said Sanders is the candidate they trust to handle a major crisis. In Illinois, 64% of Democratic voters selected Biden while 31% said Sanders is more trusted, and in Arizona, 63% said they trust Biden more to handle a major crisis compared to 31%, who pointed to Sanders. The Democratic National Committee is calling on states that haven\'t yet held their primaries to vote by mail, as coronavirus threatens future primaries. ""The simplest tool is vote by mail, which is already in use in a number of states and should be made available to all registered voters. States using vote by mail should proactively mail ballots to registered voters, where feasible, and should count all ballots as long as they are postmarked by the date of the primary,"" DNC chair Tom Perez said in a statement on Wednesday. Where in-person voting can take place in accordance with health guidelines, states should expand the days and hours of early voting to cut down on lines, Perez added. According to CBS News primary polls, nearly all likely voters in Illinois expressed at least some concern about the effects of the coronavirus, including more than half who said they are very concerned about it. Most likely voters of all ages in Illinois said they are concerned, but older voters are particularly so: 62% of voters ages 45 and over say they are very concerned, compared to 38% of younger voters. Women (59%) were also more likely than men (46%) to be very concerned. Some voters, meanwhile, said the coronavirus could change their decision to vote. In Florida, among those who said they would definitely vote and planned to do so in person on Election Day, 15% said it was very or somewhat likely that they could change their decision to vote. In Illinois, that figure was 9%, according to primary polls. The Biden campaign is optimistic it will walk away from Tuesday\'s primaries with a wider delegate lead than it had going into the contests despite the challenges to voter turnout raised because of the coronavirus. ""It would take a drastic, historically-incomparable swing for Senator Sanders to win more delegates than Biden today or to close the delegate differential,"" the campaign said in a memo released Tuesday. Heading into the four primaries held on Tuesday, Biden led Sanders by more than 100 delegates. The former vice president\'s campaign also noted that while fewer people may head to the polls on Election Day because of the coronavirus, it expects overall turnout to match that of past elections. ""While voter turnout on Election Day itself may be lower due to COVID-19 concerns, we believe that, with early vote and vote by mail, overall turnout will be roughly on pace for 2016 in Arizona and Florida and roughly on pace for 2018 in Illinois, and that voter turnout in all three states will reflect the population at large,"" the campaign said in the memo. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, on Tuesday defended the decision to keep the polls open despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. ""There are people out there today who want to say, \'Oh, it\'s a crisis, bend the rules and overstep your authority,\'"" Pritzker said. ""Let me tell you this, It is exactly in times like these, when the constitutional boundaries of our democracy should be respected above all else. And if people want to criticize me for that, well, go ahead. I\'ll wear it like a badge of honor."" Earlier Tuesday, Chicago Board of Elections spokesman Jim Allen said he urged Pritzker to prohibit voting in person and go fully vote-by-mail. Allen later apologized for the remarks. The Chicago Board of Elections said they said they\'ve had to move in total 200 precincts, with some locations in the city dropping out as soon as this morning (these cases were immediately moved to a new location). In Chicago, 126,499 votes have been cast through 2 p.m. ET, with a surge after the first two hours. Biden tweeted a reminder about polls being open in Arizona, Florida and Illinois. ""I encourage folks to vote by mail or curbside vote if you can,"" Biden wrote. ""If you vote in person, please wash your hands, don\'t touch your face, and stay 6\' from others in line."" Maryland Governor Larry Hogan announced at a press conference on Tuesday morning that the state will move its primary from April 28 until June 2. The state Board of Elections issued a statement shortly after that ""fully supports"" Hogan\'s decision. The decision follows similar action in Georgia, Kentucky and Louisiana. In a last-minute move on Monday, Ohio postponed its primary. The Ohio State Supreme Court denied a challenge to Ohio\'s primary delay filed by Wood County judicial candidate Corey Speweik, who was fighting the state of Ohio\'s decision to shut down Tuesday\'s primary and postpone voting until June over concern about the spread of the coronavirus. The process leading up to the delay was chaotic. With less than 12 hours to go before polls were scheduled to open in Ohio for the state\'s presidential primary election, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, announced polls would remain closed Tuesday amid concerns over the coronavirus. The decision came just hours after a Franklin County judge denied a request backed by the governor and secretary of state to delay the election. The Ohio Democratic Party said in a statement Tuesday that although voting did not seem feasible, it hoped the primary would be rescheduled for earlier than June 2. ""Given the chaos, confusion and mixed messages of the past 24 hours, it\'s clearly impossible for in-person voting to move forward today in Ohio,"" the party said in a statement. ""The Ohio Democratic Party strongly supports concluding the primary election earlier than June 2. Extending for that long is highly problematic for any number for reasons, and it is not at all clear that in-person voting will be possible on that date anyway,"" the statement continued. At a news conference Monday, in response to a question about the possible impact of the coronavirus outbreak, President Trump said delaying elections would be ""not a very good thing."" ""I\'d leave that up to the states,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Postponing elections is not a very good thing … I think postponing is unnecessary."" A poll by Monmouth University released on Monday showed Biden with a double-digit advantage over Sanders in Arizona. Among voters likely to participate in the primary, Biden was supported by 51% to Sanders\' 31%. Sanders leads among Latino voters by seven points, and among voters under 50 years old by wide margins. But this is more than offset by Biden\'s strong advantage among larger voter blocs, including white voters and those aged 50 and over. In head-to-head matchups with the president, Biden had a small edge Mr. Trump, but the president was virtually tied with Sanders. Although Arizona has long been a solid red state, it could be a battleground this November. Mr. Trump only won the state by 4 points against Hillary Clinton in 2016. In the Senate race, Democrat Mark Kelly had a 6-point edge in the poll over incumbent Martha McSally. "',

        ArticleContent: '"Joe Biden swept all three primaries on Tuesday night in Arizona, Florida and Illinois, CBS News projects. The contests took place amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis that led Ohio officials to postpone their primary, which had also been scheduled for Tuesday. In remarks after his early win in Florida, Biden, speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, said his campaign appeared to have had a ""very good night,"" but he also spoke about the coronavirus crisis. He told Americans that ""it\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy."" Bernie Sanders gave remarks via livestream earlier in the night. He focused mainly on the coronavirus crisis and highlighted unity. Tuesday\'s lopsided results will expand the divide in delegates between Biden and Sanders. It\'s unclear when the next primary contests will be held. Georgia, which had been set to vote on March 24, has postponed its primary, as did Louisiana, which was scheduled to go to the polls on April 4. As of 12 a.m. ET on Wednesday, Biden had increased his lead to 291 delegates. Biden now has 1,093 delegates to Sanders\' 802. To get the nomination, the Democratic candidate will need 1,991 delegates. According to CBS News primary polling in Arizona, the most important candidate quality for voters was being able to unite the country. Of those voters, 65% said they voted for Biden, while just 16% went for Sanders. The poll was mostly of voters who already voted by mail and includes those who said they were likely to show up at polls today. Like Florida and Illinois voters, 69% of Arizona voters saw Biden as the candidate with the best chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to 26% who believed the same of Sanders. Biden was also seen as the candidate trusted more to handle a major crisis. Biden led among white voters by 51% to 32%. Hispanic voters were more evenly divided: Biden 45% to Sanders 44%. CBS News projects the former vice president wins the Arizona primary, finalizing Biden\'s sweep of the three states that voted. Sixty-seven pledged delegates are up for grabs in Arizona. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose cheered the decision to postpone the state\'s primary election until June 2, saying it ""saved Ohio lives."" ""By preventing Ohioans from going to polling locations, we averted a situation which would have gone against the most recent scientific evidence available and could have dangerously advanced the spread of coronavirus across Ohio,"" the two said in a joining statement. ""It is abundantly clear that it would have been impossible to carry out a fair, accessible, and safe election today."" DeWine and LaRose stressed that Ohio voters should have a ""significant"" amount of time to cast mail-in absentee ballots and also vote in-person. Less than 12 hours before the polls were set to open in Ohio, DeWine announced that Dr. Amy Acton, director of the Ohio Department of Health, would be issuing an order to close polls ""to avoid the imminent threat with the high probability of widespread exposure to COVID-19."" As of 11 p.m. ET, Biden is leading in every county in Florida. Although Hillary Clinton won the primary in 2016, Sanders won nine counties in the northern part of the state in that contest. The Arizona secretary of state has revealed that personal information related to some protected voters was erroneously included in reports generated from the state\'s voter registration database. Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said in a statement that the error was not the result of a security breach or vulnerability. Hobbs said her office was notified from a county official that an early ballot report they compiled included ""protected voters,"" or those whose information is protected due to their jobs or if they were victims of certain crimes. Seventy-eight names were mistakenly included in the reports, the secretary of state\'s office said, and the office has asked county officials to contact those who were directly impacted. The early ballot reports are produced using data from the state\'s voter registration database, and the reports are provided by counties to political parties during elections. Hobb\'s office said the process for producing reports from the voter registration database has also been updated to prevent future errors. Biden celebrated his early wins in Illinois and Florida with a solemn address to supporters calling for the country to come together in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, while also thanking Bernie Sanders and his supporters for the ""remarkable passion"" they have brought to the Democratic race. Speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, with a backdrop of black cloth and flanked by two American flags, Biden remarked that his campaign ""has had a very good night"" and is moving closer to securing the Democratic presidential nomination. He also thanked election officials and poll workers in the three states with in-person voting for ensuring people could cast their ballots while also remaining safe. ""It\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy,"" he said. Biden said that his campaign is building a broad coalition that includes support from African-Americans, the Latino community, labor, firefighters, teachers, suburban women and others. ""We\'re doing it with a common vision,"" he said, adding that he and Sanders share that vision. The former vice president also thanked Sanders and his supporters for bringing ""remarkable passion and tenacity"" to issues like healthcare, income inequality and climate change, and delivered a message directly to young Sanders supporters. ""To young votes who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you, I know what\'s at stake. I know what we have to do,"" he said. ""Our goal as a campaign and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party and to unify the nation."" Biden also praised Americans for altering their lives as public health officials rush to limit the spread of the coronavirus, saying that Americans are ""ordinary people doing extraordinary things when the need arises and today we are moving quickly to adapt our routines to meet this challenge."" ""It\'s in moments like these we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans,"" Biden said. ""The coronavirus doesn\'t care if you\'re a Democrat or Republican. It will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender or your zip code. It will touch people in positions of power as well as the most vulnerable people in our society. We\'re all in this together."" A large number of likely voters in Illinois, 87%, said they were concerned about coronavirus, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to the primary. Biden received the support of likely voters concerned about the coronavirus by about 2-to-1. Similar percentages of likely voters are worried about the direction of the nation\'s economy in 2021, and Biden received their support by a similar margin. Sixty-four percent of likely voters in the Illinois primary picked Biden over Sanders as the person they would trust more to handle a major crisis. Likely primary voters in Illinois said beating President Trump was more important to them than having a candidate who agreed with them on the issues, and 69% said Biden would have the better chance to defeat the incumbent president in November. Polling shows Biden with a commanding lead among black likely voters – getting 70% of those polled – but he also received a majority vote of white likely voters as well, securing the support of both whites with and without college degrees. He received the support of over half of men and nearly two-thirds of women. The generational divide seen throughout this election cycle was also apparent in Illinois, with Sanders taking the vast majority of likely voters under 45, and Biden getting the strong support among older voters. But older likely voters significantly outnumbered their younger counterparts: more than six in ten likely voters were over the age of 45. And while Sanders maintains strong support of likely voters who say they are very liberal – getting nearly two-thirds support among this group – they made up just over a quarter of those polled. Biden garnered strong support among likely voters who said they were ""somewhat liberal"", and did particularly well among moderates. CBS News estimates Illinois leans toward Biden. At the moment, Chicago looks to be very close between Biden and Sanders, but many more votes are expected to be counted. The current delegate allocation in Illinois has Biden with 33 delegates and Sanders with 21. There are 155 total delegates at stake in Illinois. Following wins in the Republican primaries in Illinois and Florida, President Trump has secured the delegates needed to win the Republican presidential nomination, CBS News projects. President Trump has clinched the Republican nomination.https://t.co/E3KhCZjESV pic.twitter.com/YNT7WliBd0 — CBS News (@CBSNews) March 18, 2020 Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel offered congratulations to Mr. Trump for ""officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for president.""

Only former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld remains in the race. Most likely voters in Florida said electability was a priority for them going into the primary, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to March 17. Seventy-three percent of likely voters also think Biden would have a good chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to just 21% who picked Sanders. Voters over age 45 were more likely to say they support Biden. Those who want the next president to return to Obama policies instead of more liberal policies said they would vote for Biden. Nearly half of Florida likely voters said Sanders\' issue positions were too liberal, but most said Biden\'s issue positions were about right. Florida likely voters said they trusted Biden over Sanders by a wide margin — 59% to 37% — to handle Social Security. anders addressed supporters in a livestreamed speech after polls closed in most of Florida and called for the country to come together as local, state and federal officials respond to the coronavirus. ""I think the main point to be made tonight is that in this moment of crisis, it is imperative that we stand together, understand that right now throughout this country, there are so many of our people wondering what\'s going to happen to me tomorrow?"" Sanders said. He added that ""this is a moment that we have got to be working together."" Sanders laid out a series of proposals he said he plans to present to Democratic leadership and said an adequate response will require an ""unprecedented"" amount of money."" Sanders estimated the price tag will top $2 trillion. The plans put forth by Sanders to bolster the response to the coronavirus include allowing Medicare to cover all medical bills during the public health crisis; increasing test kits for the coronavirus and the speed at which tests are processed; activating the National Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other military resources to help expand healthcare capacity; and using emergency authority to scale up production in the U.S. of critical supplies and protective equipment. Sanders also suggested a number of measures to mitigate the economic impacts for American workers and their families, including providing a $2,000 monthly cash payment to every household for the duration of the crisis, expanding Meals on Wheels and food stamps and placing a moratorium on evictions, foreclosures and utility shutoffs. ""We must make certain that the government is getting this money into the hands of working families and the most vulnerable as quickly as possible,"" he said. Sanders said the economic crisis should not be ""another money-making opportunity"" for large corporations and Wall Street. ""We\'ve got some major crisis, but I have the strong belief that if we work together, if we do not turn to fear and panic, but if we understand that the way we solve this is by going forward as one people, remembering those who are hurting tonight and will be hurting in the future,"" he said. ""This is the richest country in the history world. This is a country with unbelievable energy, with unbelievable talent, with incredible resources. We can do it. We can address this crisis, we can minimize the pain and let us do just that."" CBS News projects Biden will win Florida, the biggest prize in Tuesday\'s primaries with 219 pledged delegates. Florida has a large Hispanic population, and Biden has previously struggled to gain support from Hispanic voters in states which have already held primaries, like Nevada. The delegate allocation at poll closing in Florida was 100 delegates for Biden, and 27 for Sanders, according to CBS News\' analysis. All polls are now closed in Florida and in Illinois, after an election day marked by fears about the spread of the coronavirus. Polls close in Arizona at 10 p.m. ET. The Ohio primary has been pushed back until June 2. Sanders will livestream remarks about the coronavirus crisis at 7:15 p.m., shortly after polls close in Florida. The speech will address how the ""response to the outbreak should put working families and the most vulnerable first,"" according to a press release from the campaign.

Although Arizona has long been a solid red state, it could be a battleground this November. Mr. Trump only won the state by 4 points against Hillary Clinton in 2016. In the Senate race, Democrat Mark Kelly had a 6-point edge in the poll over incumbent Martha McSally. "',

        ArticleContent: '"Joe Biden swept all three primaries on Tuesday night in Arizona, Florida and Illinois, CBS News projects. The contests took place amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis that led Ohio officials to postpone their primary, which had also been scheduled for Tuesday. In remarks after his early win in Florida, Biden, speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, said his campaign appeared to have had a ""very good night,"" but he also spoke about the coronavirus crisis. He told Americans that ""it\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy."" Bernie Sanders gave remarks via livestream earlier in the night. He focused mainly on the coronavirus crisis and highlighted unity. Tuesday\'s lopsided results will expand the divide in delegates between Biden and Sanders. It\'s unclear when the next primary contests will be held. Georgia, which had been set to vote on March 24, has postponed its primary, as did Louisiana, which was scheduled to go to the polls on April 4. As of 12 a.m. ET on Wednesday, Biden had increased his lead to 291 delegates. Biden now has 1,093 delegates to Sanders\' 802. To get the nomination, the Democratic candidate will need 1,991 delegates. According to CBS News primary polling in Arizona, the most important candidate quality for voters was being able to unite the country. Of those voters, 65% said they voted for Biden, while just 16% went for Sanders. The poll was mostly of voters who already voted by mail and includes those who said they were likely to show up at polls today. Like Florida and Illinois voters, 69% of Arizona voters saw Biden as the candidate with the best chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to 26% who believed the same of Sanders. Biden was also seen as the candidate trusted more to handle a major crisis. Biden led among white voters by 51% to 32%. Hispanic voters were more evenly divided: Biden 45% to Sanders 44%. CBS News projects the former vice president wins the Arizona primary, finalizing Biden\'s sweep of the three states that voted. Sixty-seven pledged delegates are up for grabs in Arizona. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose cheered the decision to postpone the state\'s primary election until June 2, saying it ""saved Ohio lives."" ""By preventing Ohioans from going to polling locations, we averted a situation which would have gone against the most recent scientific evidence available and could have dangerously advanced the spread of coronavirus across Ohio,"" the two said in a joining statement. ""It is abundantly clear that it would have been impossible to carry out a fair, accessible, and safe election today."" DeWine and LaRose stressed that Ohio voters should have a ""significant"" amount of time to cast mail-in absentee ballots and also vote in-person. Less than 12 hours before the polls were set to open in Ohio, DeWine announced that Dr. Amy Acton, director of the Ohio Department of Health, would be issuing an order to close polls ""to avoid the imminent threat with the high probability of widespread exposure to COVID-19."" As of 11 p.m. ET, Biden is leading in every county in Florida. Although Hillary Clinton won the primary in 2016, Sanders won nine counties in the northern part of the state in that contest. The Arizona secretary of state has revealed that personal information related to some protected voters was erroneously included in reports generated from the state\'s voter registration database. Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said in a statement that the error was not the result of a security breach or vulnerability. Hobbs said her office was notified from a county official that an early ballot report they compiled included ""protected voters,"" or those whose information is protected due to their jobs or if they were victims of certain crimes. Seventy-eight names were mistakenly included in the reports, the secretary of state\'s office said, and the office has asked county officials to contact those who were directly impacted. The early ballot reports are produced using data from the state\'s voter registration database, and the reports are provided by counties to political parties during elections. Hobb\'s office said the process for producing reports from the voter registration database has also been updated to prevent future errors. Biden celebrated his early wins in Illinois and Florida with a solemn address to supporters calling for the country to come together in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, while also thanking Bernie Sanders and his supporters for the ""remarkable passion"" they have brought to the Democratic race. Speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, with a backdrop of black cloth and flanked by two American flags, Biden remarked that his campaign ""has had a very good night"" and is moving closer to securing the Democratic presidential nomination. He also thanked election officials and poll workers in the three states with in-person voting for ensuring people could cast their ballots while also remaining safe. ""It\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy,"" he said. Biden said that his campaign is building a broad coalition that includes support from African-Americans, the Latino community, labor, firefighters, teachers, suburban women and others. ""We\'re doing it with a common vision,"" he said, adding that he and Sanders share that vision. The former vice president also thanked Sanders and his supporters for bringing ""remarkable passion and tenacity"" to issues like healthcare, income inequality and climate change, and delivered a message directly to young Sanders supporters. ""To young votes who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you, I know what\'s at stake. I know what we have to do,"" he said. ""Our goal as a campaign and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party and to unify the nation."" Biden also praised Americans for altering their lives as public health officials rush to limit the spread of the coronavirus, saying that Americans are ""ordinary people doing extraordinary things when the need arises and today we are moving quickly to adapt our routines to meet this challenge."" ""It\'s in moments like these we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans,"" Biden said. ""The coronavirus doesn\'t care if you\'re a Democrat or Republican. It will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender or your zip code. It will touch people in positions of power as well as the most vulnerable people in our society. We\'re all in this together."" A large number of likely voters in Illinois, 87%, said they were concerned about coronavirus, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to the primary. Biden received the support of likely voters concerned about the coronavirus by about 2-to-1. Similar percentages of likely voters are worried about the direction of the nation\'s economy in 2021, and Biden received their support by a similar margin. Sixty-four percent of likely voters in the Illinois primary picked Biden over Sanders as the person they would trust more to handle a major crisis. Likely primary voters in Illinois said beating President Trump was more important to them than having a candidate who agreed with them on the issues, and 69% said Biden would have the better chance to defeat the incumbent president in November. Polling shows Biden with a commanding lead among black likely voters – getting 70% of those polled – but he also received a majority vote of white likely voters as well, securing the support of both whites with and without college degrees. He received the support of over half of men and nearly two-thirds of women. The generational divide seen throughout this election cycle was also apparent in Illinois, with Sanders taking the vast majority of likely voters under 45, and Biden getting the strong support among older voters. But older likely voters significantly outnumbered their younger counterparts: more than six in ten likely voters were over the age of 45. And while Sanders maintains strong support of likely voters who say they are very liberal – getting nearly two-thirds support among this group – they made up just over a quarter of those polled. Biden garnered strong support among likely voters who said they were ""somewhat liberal"", and did particularly well among moderates. CBS News estimates Illinois leans toward Biden. At the moment, Chicago looks to be very close between Biden and Sanders, but many more votes are expected to be counted. The current delegate allocation in Illinois has Biden with 33 delegates and Sanders with 21. There are 155 total delegates at stake in Illinois. Following wins in the Republican primaries in Illinois and Florida, President Trump has secured the delegates needed to win the Republican presidential nomination, CBS News projects. President Trump has clinched the Republican nomination.https://t.co/E3KhCZjESV pic.twitter.com/YNT7WliBd0 — CBS News (@CBSNews) March 18, 2020 Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel offered congratulations to Mr. Trump for ""officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for president."" Congratulations to Donald J. Trump on officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for President! His home state of Florida just delivered him the delegates he needed. Our party is united, our grassroots movement is fired up, and we are ready for FOUR MORE YEARS! pic.twitter.com/B4X9IaQp7f — Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) March 18, 2020 Mr. Trump had several early challengers for the Republican nomination, though most dropped out of the race. Only former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld remains in the race. Most likely voters in Florida said electability was a priority for them going into the primary, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to March 17. Seventy-three percent of likely voters also think Biden would have a good chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to just 21% who picked Sanders. Voters over age 45 were more likely to say they support Biden. Those who want the next president to return to Obama policies instead of more liberal policies said they would vote for Biden. Nearly half of Florida likely voters said Sanders\' issue positions were too liberal, but most said Biden\'s issue positions were about right. Florida likely voters said they trusted Biden over Sanders by a wide margin — 59% to 37% — to handle Social Security. anders addressed supporters in a livestreamed speech after polls closed in most of Florida and called for the country to come together as local, state and federal officials respond to the coronavirus. ""I think the main point to be made tonight is that in this moment of crisis, it is imperative that we stand together, understand that right now throughout this country, there are so many of our people wondering what\'s going to happen to me tomorrow?"" Sanders said. He added that ""this is a moment that we have got to be working together."" Sanders laid out a series of proposals he said he plans to present to Democratic leadership and said an adequate response will require an ""unprecedented"" amount of money."" Sanders estimated the price tag will top $2 trillion. The plans put forth by Sanders to bolster the response to the coronavirus include allowing Medicare to cover all medical bills during the public health crisis; increasing test kits for the coronavirus and the speed at which tests are processed; activating the National Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other military resources to help expand healthcare capacity; and using emergency authority to scale up production in the U.S. of critical supplies and protective equipment. Sanders also suggested a number of measures to mitigate the economic impacts for American workers and their families, including providing a $2,000 monthly cash payment to every household for the duration of the crisis, expanding Meals on Wheels and food stamps and placing a moratorium on evictions, foreclosures and utility shutoffs. ""We must make certain that the government is getting this money into the hands of working families and the most vulnerable as quickly as possible,"" he said. Sanders said the economic crisis should not be ""another money-making opportunity"" for large corporations and Wall Street. ""We\'ve got some major crisis, but I have the strong belief that if we work together, if we do not turn to fear and panic, but if we understand that the way we solve this is by going forward as one people, remembering those who are hurting tonight and will be hurting in the future,"" he said. ""This is the richest country in the history world. This is a country with unbelievable energy, with unbelievable talent, with incredible resources. We can do it. We can address this crisis, we can minimize the pain and let us do just that."" CBS News projects Biden will win Florida, the biggest prize in Tuesday\'s primaries with 219 pledged delegates. Florida has a large Hispanic population, and Biden has previously struggled to gain support from Hispanic voters in states which have already held primaries, like Nevada. The delegate allocation at poll closing in Florida was 100 delegates for Biden, and 27 for Sanders, according to CBS News\' analysis. All polls are now closed in Florida and in Illinois, after an election day marked by fears about the spread of the coronavirus. Polls close in Arizona at 10 p.m. ET. The Ohio primary has been pushed back until June 2. Sanders will livestream remarks about the coronavirus crisis at 7:15 p.m., shortly after polls close in Florida. The speech will address how the ""response to the outbreak should put working families and the most vulnerable first,"" according to a press release from the campaign. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democrats said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Biden and Sanders have made remarks outlining their plans to respond to the crisis. The Florida Democratic Party said the number of Democrats who have voted early in person and by mail has exceeded turnout in the primaries in 2016. According to the state party, 141,560 more Democrats voted by mail this year than they did in the last presidential primary. Additionally, 74,031 more Democrats voted early in person this year than in 2016. The Florida Democratic Party also said it enrolled nearly 500,000 new Democrats into vote-by-mail in 2018. The party said that the coronavirus pandemic, which has impacted voting in states holding their contests today, demonstrates the need for the government to revamp voting methods. As the country deals with a health care crisis, the issue of health care remains on voters\' minds. In Arizona, Florida, and Illinois, voters picked health care as the issue that would be most important in determining their vote, according to CBS News primary polls. The second most important issue among voters in each of the three states was income inequality, followed by climate change and race relations. Likely Democratic voters in Illinois said they are also worried about the economy, primary polls show. More than eight in 10 are least somewhat concerned about the national economy over the next year. In the three states where voters will head to the polls Tuesday, most said they prefer the Democratic nominee be someone who can beat Trump — at least six in 10 in each state— over someone they agree with on major issues, according to CBS News primary polls. As has been the case throughout this campaign, there are high levels of dissatisfaction toward the Trump administration among the Democratic primary electorate. Large majorities of likely voters in Florida and Illinois and those who voted by mail in Arizona said they feel angry about the Trump administration. Among likely Democratic voters in Illinois, more Sanders supporters said they would be unhappy about Biden being the nominee than Biden supporters would be if Sanders became the nominee, according to primary polls. Fifty-four percent of Sanders supporters would be dissatisfied or upset if Biden won the nomination, compared to 37% of Biden backers who would feel that way if Sanders became the nominee. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democratic voters said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Among those polled in Florida, 71% said they trusted Biden more, compared to 23% who said Sanders is the candidate they trust to handle a major crisis. In Illinois, 64% of Democratic voters selected Biden while 31% said Sanders is more trusted, and in Arizona, 63% said they trust Biden more to handle a major crisis compared to 31%, who pointed to Sanders. The Democratic National Committee is calling on states that haven\'t yet held their primaries to vote by mail, as coronavirus threatens future primaries. ""The simplest tool is vote by mail, which is already in use in a number of states and should be made available to all registered voters. States using vote by mail should proactively mail ballots to registered voters, where feasible, and should count all ballots as long as they are postmarked by the date of the primary,"" DNC chair Tom Perez said in a statement on Wednesday. Where in-person voting can take place in accordance with health guidelines, states should expand the days and hours of early voting to cut down on lines, Perez added. According to CBS News primary polls, nearly all likely voters in Illinois expressed at least some concern about the effects of the coronavirus, including more than half who said they are very concerned about it. Most likely voters of all ages in Illinois said they are concerned, but older voters are particularly so: 62% of voters ages 45 and over say they are very concerned, compared to 38% of younger voters. Women (59%) were also more likely than men (46%) to be very concerned. Some voters, meanwhile, said the coronavirus could change their decision to vote. In Florida, among those who said they would definitely vote and planned to do so in person on Election Day, 15% said it was very or somewhat likely that they could change their decision to vote. In Illinois, that figure was 9%, according to primary polls. The Biden campaign is optimistic it will walk away from Tuesday\'s primaries with a wider delegate lead than it had going into the contests despite the challenges to voter turnout raised because of the coronavirus. ""It would take a drastic, historically-incomparable swing for Senator Sanders to win more delegates than Biden today or to close the delegate differential,"" the campaign said in a memo released Tuesday. Heading into the four primaries held on Tuesday, Biden led Sanders by more than 100 delegates. The former vice president\'s campaign also noted that while fewer people may head to the polls on Election Day because of the coronavirus, it expects overall turnout to match that of past elections. ""While voter turnout on Election Day itself may be lower due to COVID-19 concerns, we believe that, with early vote and vote by mail, overall turnout will be roughly on pace for 2016 in Arizona and Florida and roughly on pace for 2018 in Illinois, and that voter turnout in all three states will reflect the population at large,"" the campaign said in the memo. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, on Tuesday defended the decision to keep the polls open despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. ""There are people out there today who want to say, \'Oh, it\'s a crisis, bend the rules and overstep your authority,\'"" Pritzker said. ""Let me tell you this, It is exactly in times like these, when the constitutional boundaries of our democracy should be respected above all else. And if people want to criticize me for that, well, go ahead. I\'ll wear it like a badge of honor."" Earlier Tuesday, Chicago Board of Elections spokesman Jim Allen said he urged Pritzker to prohibit voting in person and go fully vote-by-mail. Allen later apologized for the remarks. The Chicago Board of Elections said they said they\'ve had to move in total 200 precincts, with some locations in the city dropping out as soon as this morning (these cases were immediately moved to a new location). In Chicago, 126,499 votes have been cast through 2 p.m. ET, with a surge after the first two hours. Biden tweeted a reminder about polls being open in Arizona, Florida and Illinois. ""I encourage folks to vote by mail or curbside vote if you can,"" Biden wrote. ""If you vote in person, please wash your hands, don\'t touch your face, and stay 6\' from others in line."" Maryland Governor Larry Hogan announced at a press conference on Tuesday morning that the state will move its primary from April 28 until June 2. The state Board of Elections issued a statement shortly after that ""fully supports"" Hogan\'s decision. The decision follows similar action in Georgia, Kentucky and Louisiana. In a last-minute move on Monday, Ohio postponed its primary. The Ohio State Supreme Court denied a challenge to Ohio\'s primary delay filed by Wood County judicial candidate Corey Speweik, who was fighting the state of Ohio\'s decision to shut down Tuesday\'s primary and postpone voting until June over concern about the spread of the coronavirus. The process leading up to the delay was chaotic. With less than 12 hours to go before polls were scheduled to open in Ohio for the state\'s presidential primary election, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, announced polls would remain closed Tuesday amid concerns over the coronavirus. The decision came just hours after a Franklin County judge denied a request backed by the governor and secretary of state to delay the election. The Ohio Democratic Party said in a statement Tuesday that although voting did not seem feasible, it hoped the primary would be rescheduled for earlier than June 2. ""Given the chaos, confusion and mixed messages of the past 24 hours, it\'s clearly impossible for in-person voting to move forward today in Ohio,"" the party said in a statement. ""The Ohio Democratic Party strongly supports concluding the primary election earlier than June 2. Extending for that long is highly problematic for any number for reasons, and it is not at all clear that in-person voting will be possible on that date anyway,"" the statement continued. At a news conference Monday, in response to a question about the possible impact of the coronavirus outbreak, President Trump said delaying elections would be ""not a very good thing."" ""I\'d leave that up to the states,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Postponing elections is not a very good thing … I think postponing is unnecessary."" A poll by Monmouth University released on Monday showed Biden with a double-digit advantage over Sanders in Arizona. Among voters likely to participate in the primary, Biden was supported by 51% to Sanders\' 31%. Sanders leads among Latino voters by seven points, and among voters under 50 years old by wide margins. But this is more than offset by Biden\'s strong advantage among larger voter blocs, including white voters and those aged 50 and over. In head-to-head matchups with the president, Biden had a small edge Mr. Trump, but the president was virtually tied with Sanders. Although Arizona has long been a solid red state, it could be a battleground this November. Mr. Trump only won the state by 4 points against Hillary Clinton in 2016. In the Senate race, Democrat Mark Kelly had a 6-point edge in the poll over incumbent Martha McSally. "',
        AnswerContent: '"WASHINGTON — Joe Biden will look to build on his dominant lead in the Democratic presidential race when three states cast votes on Tuesday, but Ohio postponed its planned primary over health concerns amid the coronavirus outbreak. Biden, the front-runner and former vice president, hopes big victories in nominating contests in Florida, Illinois and Arizona can help him amass a nearly unassailable edge over rival Bernie Sanders in the race to find a challenger to Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election. Biden leads Sanders in opinion polls in all three states. Ohio also was scheduled to hold a primary on Tuesday, but Governor Mike DeWine said public health concerns made in-person voting too dangerous and delayed it until June 2. A county judge blocked his first effort to postpone the vote, but the state health director ordered the polls shut as a health emergency. ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" DeWine said on Twitter. Officials in the three other states vowed to press ahead with voting and assured the public it was safe despite fears about the coronavirus, which has dramatically altered American life, disrupted campaign routines and prompted other states to postpone future voting. On Monday, the White House issued guidelines to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people and close bars and restaurants. Schools, businesses, sporting events and concerts have been shuttered across the country, raising questions about the wisdom of voting during a global pandemic. But in Florida, Illinois and Arizona, officials said they were taking precautions such as extending early voting hours and moving polling places away from assisted-living facilities - even as some scrambled to find more poll workers to replace those who had backed out. There were more than 4,300 cases of the respiratory virus across the United States and 80 deaths as of Monday night. In Florida, the largest state to vote, with 219 delegates at stake, more than 1 million people had already cast Democratic ballots by mail or early in-person voting. In Illinois, nearly 800,000 votes had been cast by mail or through early voting - a substantial increase from the day before the 2016 primary. ""We believe that by following guidance from our state and federal health professionals, voters can vote safely at early voting sites today and at polling places tomorrow,"" said Matt Dietrich, a spokesman for the Illinois Board of Elections. ""Also, at this point there is no date in the foreseeable future when we can expect greater safety with any certainty,"" he added. The presidential race will enter uncertain territory after Tuesday\'s voting. Both Biden and Sanders have dropped off the campaign trail to help prevent the spread of the virus, and the race could face an extended hiatus if more states postpone voting. Biden has taken command of the contest in the past two weeks, consolidating Democratic support with a string of decisive primary wins over Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont and a democratic socialist with a sweeping agenda to restructure the economy. Biden\'s victories in 16 of the last 21 state primaries have given him a lead of roughly 150 delegates over Sanders in the chase for the 1,991 delegates needed to win the nomination at July\'s Democratic convention. There are 441 delegates at stake in Florida, Illinois and Arizona, and a sweep would make it increasingly unrealistic that Sanders could catch up. Sanders has vowed to stay in the race despite Biden\'s string of recent wins. He attacked Biden\'s Senate voting record and leadership on a range of issues during their first one-on-one debate on Sunday, held in Washington without an on-site audience to avoid the possible spread of the virus. But Sanders could face renewed pressure to end his bid if he loses badly on Tuesday. Many Democrats do not want a repeat of 2016, when they believe Sanders\' long and bitter primary battle with Hillary Clinton played a role in her upset loss to Trump. The next scheduled primary in Georgia on March 24 has been postponed, along with the April 4 primary in Louisiana, one of four states scheduled to vote that day, and Kentucky\'s May 19 primary. Wyoming, which is also scheduled to vote on April 4, has suspended in-person voting in favor of ballot drop-offs and vote-by-mail. The primary schedule thins out in April, with Wisconsin on April 7 and nothing else until six states vote on April 28. "',

        ArticleContent: '"Joe Biden swept all three primaries on Tuesday night in Arizona, Florida and Illinois, CBS News projects. The contests took place amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis that led Ohio officials to postpone their primary, which had also been scheduled for Tuesday. In remarks after his early win in Florida, Biden, speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, said his campaign appeared to have had a ""very good night,"" but he also spoke about the coronavirus crisis. He told Americans that ""it\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy."" Bernie Sanders gave remarks via livestream earlier in the night. He focused mainly on the coronavirus crisis and highlighted unity. Tuesday\'s lopsided results will expand the divide in delegates between Biden and Sanders. It\'s unclear when the next primary contests will be held. Georgia, which had been set to vote on March 24, has postponed its primary, as did Louisiana, which was scheduled to go to the polls on April 4. As of 12 a.m. ET on Wednesday, Biden had increased his lead to 291 delegates. Biden now has 1,093 delegates to Sanders\' 802. To get the nomination, the Democratic candidate will need 1,991 delegates. According to CBS News primary polling in Arizona, the most important candidate quality for voters was being able to unite the country. Of those voters, 65% said they voted for Biden, while just 16% went for Sanders. The poll was mostly of voters who already voted by mail and includes those who said they were likely to show up at polls today. Like Florida and Illinois voters, 69% of Arizona voters saw Biden as the candidate with the best chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to 26% who believed the same of Sanders. Biden was also seen as the candidate trusted more to handle a major crisis. Biden led among white voters by 51% to 32%. Hispanic voters were more evenly divided: Biden 45% to Sanders 44%. CBS News projects the former vice president wins the Arizona primary, finalizing Biden\'s sweep of the three states that voted. Sixty-seven pledged delegates are up for grabs in Arizona. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose cheered the decision to postpone the state\'s primary election until June 2, saying it ""saved Ohio lives."" ""By preventing Ohioans from going to polling locations, we averted a situation which would have gone against the most recent scientific evidence available and could have dangerously advanced the spread of coronavirus across Ohio,"" the two said in a joining statement. ""It is abundantly clear that it would have been impossible to carry out a fair, accessible, and safe election today."" DeWine and LaRose stressed that Ohio voters should have a ""significant"" amount of time to cast mail-in absentee ballots and also vote in-person. Less than 12 hours before the polls were set to open in Ohio, DeWine announced that Dr. Amy Acton, director of the Ohio Department of Health, would be issuing an order to close polls ""to avoid the imminent threat with the high probability of widespread exposure to COVID-19."" As of 11 p.m. ET, Biden is leading in every county in Florida. Although Hillary Clinton won the primary in 2016, Sanders won nine counties in the northern part of the state in that contest. The Arizona secretary of state has revealed that personal information related to some protected voters was erroneously included in reports generated from the state\'s voter registration database. Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said in a statement that the error was not the result of a security breach or vulnerability. Hobbs said her office was notified from a county official that an early ballot report they compiled included ""protected voters,"" or those whose information is protected due to their jobs or if they were victims of certain crimes. Seventy-eight names were mistakenly included in the reports, the secretary of state\'s office said, and the office has asked county officials to contact those who were directly impacted. The early ballot reports are produced using data from the state\'s voter registration database, and the reports are provided by counties to political parties during elections. Hobb\'s office said the process for producing reports from the voter registration database has also been updated to prevent future errors. Biden celebrated his early wins in Illinois and Florida with a solemn address to supporters calling for the country to come together in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, while also thanking Bernie Sanders and his supporters for the ""remarkable passion"" they have brought to the Democratic race. Speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, with a backdrop of black cloth and flanked by two American flags, Biden remarked that his campaign ""has had a very good night"" and is moving closer to securing the Democratic presidential nomination. He also thanked election officials and poll workers in the three states with in-person voting for ensuring people could cast their ballots while also remaining safe. ""It\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy,"" he said. Biden said that his campaign is building a broad coalition that includes support from African-Americans, the Latino community, labor, firefighters, teachers, suburban women and others. ""We\'re doing it with a common vision,"" he said, adding that he and Sanders share that vision. The former vice president also thanked Sanders and his supporters for bringing ""remarkable passion and tenacity"" to issues like healthcare, income inequality and climate change, and delivered a message directly to young Sanders supporters. ""To young votes who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you, I know what\'s at stake. I know what we have to do,"" he said. ""Our goal as a campaign and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party and to unify the nation."" Biden also praised Americans for altering their lives as public health officials rush to limit the spread of the coronavirus, saying that Americans are ""ordinary people doing extraordinary things when the need arises and today we are moving quickly to adapt our routines to meet this challenge."" ""It\'s in moments like these we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans,"" Biden said. ""The coronavirus doesn\'t care if you\'re a Democrat or Republican. It will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender or your zip code. It will touch people in positions of power as well as the most vulnerable people in our society. We\'re all in this together."" A large number of likely voters in Illinois, 87%, said they were concerned about coronavirus, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to the primary. Biden received the support of likely voters concerned about the coronavirus by about 2-to-1. Similar percentages of likely voters are worried about the direction of the nation\'s economy in 2021, and Biden received their support by a similar margin. Sixty-four percent of likely voters in the Illinois primary picked Biden over Sanders as the person they would trust more to handle a major crisis. Likely primary voters in Illinois said beating President Trump was more important to them than having a candidate who agreed with them on the issues, and 69% said Biden would have the better chance to defeat the incumbent president in November. Polling shows Biden with a commanding lead among black likely voters – getting 70% of those polled – but he also received a majority vote of white likely voters as well, securing the support of both whites with and without college degrees. He received the support of over half of men and nearly two-thirds of women. The generational divide seen throughout this election cycle was also apparent in Illinois, with Sanders taking the vast majority of likely voters under 45, and Biden getting the strong support among older voters. But older likely voters significantly outnumbered their younger counterparts: more than six in ten likely voters were over the age of 45. And while Sanders maintains strong support of likely voters who say they are very liberal – getting nearly two-thirds support among this group – they made up just over a quarter of those polled. Biden garnered strong support among likely voters who said they were ""somewhat liberal"", and did particularly well among moderates. CBS News estimates Illinois leans toward Biden. At the moment, Chicago looks to be very close between Biden and Sanders, but many more votes are expected to be counted. The current delegate allocation in Illinois has Biden with 33 delegates and Sanders with 21. There are 155 total delegates at stake in Illinois. Following wins in the Republican primaries in Illinois and Florida, President Trump has secured the delegates needed to win the Republican presidential nomination, CBS News projects. President Trump has clinched the Republican nomination.https://t.co/E3KhCZjESV pic.twitter.com/YNT7WliBd0 — CBS News (@CBSNews) March 18, 2020 Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel offered congratulations to Mr. Trump for ""officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for president.""

Only former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld remains in the race. Most likely voters in Florida said electability was a priority for them going into the primary, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to March 17. Seventy-three percent of likely voters also think Biden would have a good chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to just 21% who picked Sanders. Voters over age 45 were more likely to say they support Biden. Those who want the next president to return to Obama policies instead of more liberal policies said they would vote for Biden. Nearly half of Florida likely voters said Sanders\' issue positions were too liberal, but most said Biden\'s issue positions were about right. Florida likely voters said they trusted Biden over Sanders by a wide margin — 59% to 37% — to handle Social Security. anders addressed supporters in a livestreamed speech after polls closed in most of Florida and called for the country to come together as local, state and federal officials respond to the coronavirus. ""I think the main point to be made tonight is that in this moment of crisis, it is imperative that we stand together, understand that right now throughout this country, there are so many of our people wondering what\'s going to happen to me tomorrow?"" Sanders said. He added that ""this is a moment that we have got to be working together."" Sanders laid out a series of proposals he said he plans to present to Democratic leadership and said an adequate response will require an ""unprecedented"" amount of money."" Sanders estimated the price tag will top $2 trillion. The plans put forth by Sanders to bolster the response to the coronavirus include allowing Medicare to cover all medical bills during the public health crisis; increasing test kits for the coronavirus and the speed at which tests are processed; activating the National Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other military resources to help expand healthcare capacity; and using emergency authority to scale up production in the U.S. of critical supplies and protective equipment. Sanders also suggested a number of measures to mitigate the economic impacts for American workers and their families, including providing a $2,000 monthly cash payment to every household for the duration of the crisis, expanding Meals on Wheels and food stamps and placing a moratorium on evictions, foreclosures and utility shutoffs. ""We must make certain that the government is getting this money into the hands of working families and the most vulnerable as quickly as possible,"" he said. Sanders said the economic crisis should not be ""another money-making opportunity"" for large corporations and Wall Street. ""We\'ve got some major crisis, but I have the strong belief that if we work together, if we do not turn to fear and panic, but if we understand that the way we solve this is by going forward as one people, remembering those who are hurting tonight and will be hurting in the future,"" he said. ""This is the richest country in the history world. This is a country with unbelievable energy, with unbelievable talent, with incredible resources. We can do it. We can address this crisis, we can minimize the pain and let us do just that."" CBS News projects Biden will win Florida, the biggest prize in Tuesday\'s primaries with 219 pledged delegates. Florida has a large Hispanic population, and Biden has previously struggled to gain support from Hispanic voters in states which have already held primaries, like Nevada. The delegate allocation at poll closing in Florida was 100 delegates for Biden, and 27 for Sanders, according to CBS News\' analysis. All polls are now closed in Florida and in Illinois, after an election day marked by fears about the spread of the coronavirus. Polls close in Arizona at 10 p.m. ET. The Ohio primary has been pushed back until June 2. Sanders will livestream remarks about the coronavirus crisis at 7:15 p.m., shortly after polls close in Florida. The speech will address how the ""response to the outbreak should put working families and the most vulnerable first,"" according to a press release from the campaign. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democrats said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Biden and Sanders have made remarks outlining their plans to respond to the crisis. The Florida Democratic Party said the number of Democrats who have voted early in person and by mail has exceeded turnout in the primaries in 2016. According to the state party, 141,560 more Democrats voted by mail this year than they did in the last presidential primary. Additionally, 74,031 more Democrats voted early in person this year than in 2016. The Florida Democratic Party also said it enrolled nearly 500,000 new Democrats into vote-by-mail in 2018. The party said that the coronavirus pandemic, which has impacted voting in states holding their contests today, demonstrates the need for the government to revamp voting methods. As the country deals with a health care crisis, the issue of health care remains on voters\' minds. In Arizona, Florida, and Illinois, voters picked health care as the issue that would be most important in determining their vote, according to CBS News primary polls. The second most important issue among voters in each of the three states was income inequality, followed by climate change and race relations. Likely Democratic voters in Illinois said they are also worried about the economy, primary polls show. More than eight in 10 are least somewhat concerned about the national economy over the next year. In the three states where voters will head to the polls Tuesday, most said they prefer the Democratic nominee be someone who can beat Trump — at least six in 10 in each state— over someone they agree with on major issues, according to CBS News primary polls. As has been the case throughout this campaign, there are high levels of dissatisfaction toward the Trump administration among the Democratic primary electorate. Large majorities of likely voters in Florida and Illinois and those who voted by mail in Arizona said they feel angry about the Trump administration. Among likely Democratic voters in Illinois, more Sanders supporters said they would be unhappy about Biden being the nominee than Biden supporters would be if Sanders became the nominee, according to primary polls. Fifty-four percent of Sanders supporters would be dissatisfied or upset if Biden won the nomination, compared to 37% of Biden backers who would feel that way if Sanders became the nominee. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democratic voters said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Among those polled in Florida, 71% said they trusted Biden more, compared to 23% who said Sanders is the candidate they trust to handle a major crisis. In Illinois, 64% of Democratic voters selected Biden while 31% said Sanders is more trusted, and in Arizona, 63% said they trust Biden more to handle a major crisis compared to 31%, who pointed to Sanders. The Democratic National Committee is calling on states that haven\'t yet held their primaries to vote by mail, as coronavirus threatens future primaries. ""The simplest tool is vote by mail, which is already in use in a number of states and should be made available to all registered voters. States using vote by mail should proactively mail ballots to registered voters, where feasible, and should count all ballots as long as they are postmarked by the date of the primary,"" DNC chair Tom Perez said in a statement on Wednesday. Where in-person voting can take place in accordance with health guidelines, states should expand the days and hours of early voting to cut down on lines, Perez added. According to CBS News primary polls, nearly all likely voters in Illinois expressed at least some concern about the effects of the coronavirus, including more than half who said they are very concerned about it. Most likely voters of all ages in Illinois said they are concerned, but older voters are particularly so: 62% of voters ages 45 and over say they are very concerned, compared to 38% of younger voters. Women (59%) were also more likely than men (46%) to be very concerned. Some voters, meanwhile, said the coronavirus could change their decision to vote. In Florida, among those who said they would definitely vote and planned to do so in person on Election Day, 15% said it was very or somewhat likely that they could change their decision to vote. In Illinois, that figure was 9%, according to primary polls. The Biden campaign is optimistic it will walk away from Tuesday\'s primaries with a wider delegate lead than it had going into the contests despite the challenges to voter turnout raised because of the coronavirus. ""It would take a drastic, historically-incomparable swing for Senator Sanders to win more delegates than Biden today or to close the delegate differential,"" the campaign said in a memo released Tuesday. Heading into the four primaries held on Tuesday, Biden led Sanders by more than 100 delegates. The former vice president\'s campaign also noted that while fewer people may head to the polls on Election Day because of the coronavirus, it expects overall turnout to match that of past elections. ""While voter turnout on Election Day itself may be lower due to COVID-19 concerns, we believe that, with early vote and vote by mail, overall turnout will be roughly on pace for 2016 in Arizona and Florida and roughly on pace for 2018 in Illinois, and that voter turnout in all three states will reflect the population at large,"" the campaign said in the memo. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, on Tuesday defended the decision to keep the polls open despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. ""There are people out there today who want to say, \'Oh, it\'s a crisis, bend the rules and overstep your authority,\'"" Pritzker said. ""Let me tell you this, It is exactly in times like these, when the constitutional boundaries of our democracy should be respected above all else. And if people want to criticize me for that, well, go ahead. I\'ll wear it like a badge of honor."" Earlier Tuesday, Chicago Board of Elections spokesman Jim Allen said he urged Pritzker to prohibit voting in person and go fully vote-by-mail. Allen later apologized for the remarks. The Chicago Board of Elections said they said they\'ve had to move in total 200 precincts, with some locations in the city dropping out as soon as this morning (these cases were immediately moved to a new location). In Chicago, 126,499 votes have been cast through 2 p.m. ET, with a surge after the first two hours. Biden tweeted a reminder about polls being open in Arizona, Florida and Illinois. ""I encourage folks to vote by mail or curbside vote if you can,"" Biden wrote. ""If you vote in person, please wash your hands, don\'t touch your face, and stay 6\' from others in line."" Maryland Governor Larry Hogan announced at a press conference on Tuesday morning that the state will move its primary from April 28 until June 2. The state Board of Elections issued a statement shortly after that ""fully supports"" Hogan\'s decision. The decision follows similar action in Georgia, Kentucky and Louisiana. In a last-minute move on Monday, Ohio postponed its primary. The Ohio State Supreme Court denied a challenge to Ohio\'s primary delay filed by Wood County judicial candidate Corey Speweik, who was fighting the state of Ohio\'s decision to shut down Tuesday\'s primary and postpone voting until June over concern about the spread of the coronavirus. The process leading up to the delay was chaotic. With less than 12 hours to go before polls were scheduled to open in Ohio for the state\'s presidential primary election, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, announced polls would remain closed Tuesday amid concerns over the coronavirus. The decision came just hours after a Franklin County judge denied a request backed by the governor and secretary of state to delay the election. The Ohio Democratic Party said in a statement Tuesday that although voting did not seem feasible, it hoped the primary would be rescheduled for earlier than June 2. ""Given the chaos, confusion and mixed messages of the past 24 hours, it\'s clearly impossible for in-person voting to move forward today in Ohio,"" the party said in a statement. ""The Ohio Democratic Party strongly supports concluding the primary election earlier than June 2. Extending for that long is highly problematic for any number for reasons, and it is not at all clear that in-person voting will be possible on that date anyway,"" the statement continued. At a news conference Monday, in response to a question about the possible impact of the coronavirus outbreak, President Trump said delaying elections would be ""not a very good thing."" ""I\'d leave that up to the states,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Postponing elections is not a very good thing … I think postponing is unnecessary."" A poll by Monmouth University released on Monday showed Biden with a double-digit advantage over Sanders in Arizona. Among voters likely to participate in the primary, Biden was supported by 51% to Sanders\' 31%. Sanders leads among Latino voters by seven points, and among voters under 50 years old by wide margins. But this is more than offset by Biden\'s strong advantage among larger voter blocs, including white voters and those aged 50 and over. In head-to-head matchups with the president, Biden had a small edge Mr. Trump, but the president was virtually tied with Sanders. Although Arizona has long been a solid red state, it could be a battleground this November. Mr. Trump only won the state by 4 points against Hillary Clinton in 2016. In the Senate race, Democrat Mark Kelly had a 6-point edge in the poll over incumbent Martha McSally. "',

        ArticleContent: '"Joe Biden swept all three primaries on Tuesday night in Arizona, Florida and Illinois, CBS News projects. The contests took place amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis that led Ohio officials to postpone their primary, which had also been scheduled for Tuesday.

He told Americans that ""it\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy."" Bernie Sanders gave remarks via livestream earlier in the night. He focused mainly on the coronavirus crisis and highlighted unity. Tuesday\'s lopsided results will expand the divide in delegates between Biden and Sanders. It\'s unclear when the next primary contests will be held. Georgia, which had been set to vote on March 24, has postponed its primary, as did Louisiana, which was scheduled to go to the polls on April 4. As of 12 a.m. ET on Wednesday, Biden had increased his lead to 291 delegates. Biden now has 1,093 delegates to Sanders\' 802. To get the nomination, the Democratic candidate will need 1,991 delegates.

""We\'ve got some major crisis, but I have the strong belief that if we work together, if we do not turn to fear and panic, but if we understand that the way we solve this is by going forward as one people, remembering those who are hurting tonight and will be hurting in the future,"" he said. ""This is the richest country in the history world. This is a country with unbelievable energy, with unbelievable talent, with incredible resources. We can do it. We can address this crisis, we can minimize the pain and let us do just that."" CBS News projects Biden will win Florida, the biggest prize in Tuesday\'s primaries with 219 pledged delegates. Florida has a large Hispanic population, and Biden has previously struggled to gain support from Hispanic voters in states which have already held primaries, like Nevada. The delegate allocation at poll closing in Florida was 100 delegates for Biden, and 27 for Sanders, according to CBS News\' analysis. All polls are now closed in Florida and in Illinois, after an election day marked by fears about the spread of the coronavirus. Polls close in Arizona at 10 p.m. ET. The Ohio primary has been pushed back until June 2. Sanders will livestream remarks about the coronavirus crisis at 7:15 p.m., shortly after polls close in Florida. The speech will address how the ""response to the outbreak should put working families and the most vulnerable first,"" according to a press release from the campaign. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democrats said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Biden and Sanders have made remarks outlining their plans to respond to the crisis. The Florida Democratic Party said the number of Democrats who have voted early in person and by mail has exceeded turnout in the primaries in 2016. According to the state party, 141,560 more Democrats voted by mail this year than they did in the last presidential primary. Additionally, 74,031 more Democrats voted early in person this year than in 2016. The Florida Democratic Party also said it enrolled nearly 500,000 new Democrats into vote-by-mail in 2018. The party said that the coronavirus pandemic, which has impacted voting in states holding their contests today, demonstrates the need for the government to revamp voting methods. As the country deals with a health care crisis, the issue of health care remains on voters\' minds. In Arizona, Florida, and Illinois, voters picked health care as the issue that would be most important in determining their vote, according to CBS News primary polls. The second most important issue among voters in each of the three states was income inequality, followed by climate change and race relations. Likely Democratic voters in Illinois said they are also worried about the economy, primary polls show. More than eight in 10 are least somewhat concerned about the national economy over the next year. In the three states where voters will head to the polls Tuesday, most said they prefer the Democratic nominee be someone who can beat Trump — at least six in 10 in each state— over someone they agree with on major issues, according to CBS News primary polls. As has been the case throughout this campaign, there are high levels of dissatisfaction toward the Trump administration among the Democratic primary electorate. Large majorities of likely voters in Florida and Illinois and those who voted by mail in Arizona said they feel angry about the Trump administration. Among likely Democratic voters in Illinois, more Sanders supporters said they would be unhappy about Biden being the nominee than Biden supporters would be if Sanders became the nominee, according to primary polls. Fifty-four percent of Sanders supporters would be dissatisfied or upset if Biden won the nomination, compared to 37% of Biden backers who would feel that way if Sanders became the nominee. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democratic voters said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Among those polled in Florida, 71% said they trusted Biden more, compared to 23% who said Sanders is the candidate they trust to handle a major crisis. In Illinois, 64% of Democratic voters selected Biden while 31% said Sanders is more trusted, and in Arizona, 63% said they trust Biden more to handle a major crisis compared to 31%, who pointed to Sanders. The Democratic National Committee is calling on states that haven\'t yet held their primaries to vote by mail, as coronavirus threatens future primaries. ""The simplest tool is vote by mail, which is already in use in a number of states and should be made available to all registered voters. States using vote by mail should proactively mail ballots to registered voters, where feasible, and should count all ballots as long as they are postmarked by the date of the primary,"" DNC chair Tom Perez said in a statement on Wednesday. Where in-person voting can take place in accordance with health guidelines, states should expand the days and hours of early voting to cut down on lines, Perez added. According to CBS News primary polls, nearly all likely voters in Illinois expressed at least some concern about the effects of the coronavirus, including more than half who said they are very concerned about it. Most likely voters of all ages in Illinois said they are concerned, but older voters are particularly so: 62% of voters ages 45 and over say they are very concerned, compared to 38% of younger voters. Women (59%) were also more likely than men (46%) to be very concerned. Some voters, meanwhile, said the coronavirus could change their decision to vote. In Florida, among those who said they would definitely vote and planned to do so in person on Election Day, 15% said it was very or somewhat likely that they could change their decision to vote. In Illinois, that figure was 9%, according to primary polls. The Biden campaign is optimistic it will walk away from Tuesday\'s primaries with a wider delegate lead than it had going into the contests despite the challenges to voter turnout raised because of the coronavirus. ""It would take a drastic, historically-incomparable swing for Senator Sanders to win more delegates than Biden today or to close the delegate differential,"" the campaign said in a memo released Tuesday. Heading into the four primaries held on Tuesday, Biden led Sanders by more than 100 delegates. The former vice president\'s campaign also noted that while fewer people may head to the polls on Election Day because of the coronavirus, it expects overall turnout to match that of past elections. ""While voter turnout on Election Day itself may be lower due to COVID-19 concerns, we believe that, with early vote and vote by mail, overall turnout will be roughly on pace for 2016 in Arizona and Florida and roughly on pace for 2018 in Illinois, and that voter turnout in all three states will reflect the population at large,"" the campaign said in the memo. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, on Tuesday defended the decision to keep the polls open despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. ""There are people out there today who want to say, \'Oh, it\'s a crisis, bend the rules and overstep your authority,\'"" Pritzker said. ""Let me tell you this, It is exactly in times like these, when the constitutional boundaries of our democracy should be respected above all else. And if people want to criticize me for that, well, go ahead. I\'ll wear it like a badge of honor."" Earlier Tuesday, Chicago Board of Elections spokesman Jim Allen said he urged Pritzker to prohibit voting in person and go fully vote-by-mail. Allen later apologized for the remarks. The Chicago Board of Elections said they said they\'ve had to move in total 200 precincts, with some locations in the city dropping out as soon as this morning (these cases were immediately moved to a new location). In Chicago, 126,499 votes have been cast through 2 p.m. ET, with a surge after the first two hours. Biden tweeted a reminder about polls being open in Arizona, Florida and Illinois. ""I encourage folks to vote by mail or curbside vote if you can,"" Biden wrote. ""If you vote in person, please wash your hands, don\'t touch your face, and stay 6\' from others in line."" Maryland Governor Larry Hogan announced at a press conference on Tuesday morning that the state will move its primary from April 28 until June 2. The state Board of Elections issued a statement shortly after that ""fully supports"" Hogan\'s decision. The decision follows similar action in Georgia, Kentucky and Louisiana. In a last-minute move on Monday, Ohio postponed its primary. The Ohio State Supreme Court denied a challenge to Ohio\'s primary delay filed by Wood County judicial candidate Corey Speweik, who was fighting the state of Ohio\'s decision to shut down Tuesday\'s primary and postpone voting until June over concern about the spread of the coronavirus. The process leading up to the delay was chaotic. With less than 12 hours to go before polls were scheduled to open in Ohio for the state\'s presidential primary election, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, announced polls would remain closed Tuesday amid concerns over the coronavirus. The decision came just hours after a Franklin County judge denied a request backed by the governor and secretary of state to delay the election. The Ohio Democratic Party said in a statement Tuesday that although voting did not seem feasible, it hoped the primary would be rescheduled for earlier than June 2. ""Given the chaos, confusion and mixed messages of the past 24 hours, it\'s clearly impossible for in-person voting to move forward today in Ohio,"" the party said in a statement. ""The Ohio Democratic Party strongly supports concluding the primary election earlier than June 2. Extending for that long is highly problematic for any number for reasons, and it is not at all clear that in-person voting will be possible on that date anyway,"" the statement continued. At a news conference Monday, in response to a question about the possible impact of the coronavirus outbreak, President Trump said delaying elections would be ""not a very good thing."" ""I\'d leave that up to the states,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Postponing elections is not a very good thing … I think postponing is unnecessary."" A poll by Monmouth University released on Monday showed Biden with a double-digit advantage over Sanders in Arizona. Among voters likely to participate in the primary, Biden was supported by 51% to Sanders\' 31%. Sanders leads among Latino voters by seven points, and among voters under 50 years old by wide margins. But this is more than offset by Biden\'s strong advantage among larger voter blocs, including white voters and those aged 50 and over. In head-to-head matchups with the president, Biden had a small edge Mr. Trump, but the president was virtually tied with Sanders. Although Arizona has long been a solid red state, it could be a battleground this November. Mr. Trump only won the state by 4 points against Hillary Clinton in 2016. In the Senate race, Democrat Mark Kelly had a 6-point edge in the poll over incumbent Martha McSally. "',

        ArticleContent: '"Joe Biden swept all three primaries on Tuesday night in Arizona, Florida and Illinois, CBS News projects. The contests took place amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis that led Ohio officials to postpone their primary, which had also been scheduled for Tuesday. In remarks after his early win in Florida, Biden, speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, said his campaign appeared to have had a ""very good night,"" but he also spoke about the coronavirus crisis. He told Americans that ""it\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy."" Bernie Sanders gave remarks via livestream earlier in the night. He focused mainly on the coronavirus crisis and highlighted unity. Tuesday\'s lopsided results will expand the divide in delegates between Biden and Sanders. It\'s unclear when the next primary contests will be held. Georgia, which had been set to vote on March 24, has postponed its primary, as did Louisiana, which was scheduled to go to the polls on April 4. As of 12 a.m. ET on Wednesday, Biden had increased his lead to 291 delegates. Biden now has 1,093 delegates to Sanders\' 802. To get the nomination, the Democratic candidate will need 1,991 delegates. According to CBS News primary polling in Arizona, the most important candidate quality for voters was being able to unite the country. Of those voters, 65% said they voted for Biden, while just 16% went for Sanders. The poll was mostly of voters who already voted by mail and includes those who said they were likely to show up at polls today. Like Florida and Illinois voters, 69% of Arizona voters saw Biden as the candidate with the best chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to 26% who believed the same of Sanders. Biden was also seen as the candidate trusted more to handle a major crisis. Biden led among white voters by 51% to 32%. Hispanic voters were more evenly divided: Biden 45% to Sanders 44%. CBS News projects the former vice president wins the Arizona primary, finalizing Biden\'s sweep of the three states that voted. Sixty-seven pledged delegates are up for grabs in Arizona. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose cheered the decision to postpone the state\'s primary election until June 2, saying it ""saved Ohio lives."" ""By preventing Ohioans from going to polling locations, we averted a situation which would have gone against the most recent scientific evidence available and could have dangerously advanced the spread of coronavirus across Ohio,"" the two said in a joining statement. ""It is abundantly clear that it would have been impossible to carry out a fair, accessible, and safe election today."" DeWine and LaRose stressed that Ohio voters should have a ""significant"" amount of time to cast mail-in absentee ballots and also vote in-person. Less than 12 hours before the polls were set to open in Ohio, DeWine announced that Dr. Amy Acton, director of the Ohio Department of Health, would be issuing an order to close polls ""to avoid the imminent threat with the high probability of widespread exposure to COVID-19."" As of 11 p.m. ET, Biden is leading in every county in Florida. Although Hillary Clinton won the primary in 2016, Sanders won nine counties in the northern part of the state in that contest. The Arizona secretary of state has revealed that personal information related to some protected voters was erroneously included in reports generated from the state\'s voter registration database. Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said in a statement that the error was not the result of a security breach or vulnerability. Hobbs said her office was notified from a county official that an early ballot report they compiled included ""protected voters,"" or those whose information is protected due to their jobs or if they were victims of certain crimes. Seventy-eight names were mistakenly included in the reports, the secretary of state\'s office said, and the office has asked county officials to contact those who were directly impacted. The early ballot reports are produced using data from the state\'s voter registration database, and the reports are provided by counties to political parties during elections. Hobb\'s office said the process for producing reports from the voter registration database has also been updated to prevent future errors. Biden celebrated his early wins in Illinois and Florida with a solemn address to supporters calling for the country to come together in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, while also thanking Bernie Sanders and his supporters for the ""remarkable passion"" they have brought to the Democratic race. Speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, with a backdrop of black cloth and flanked by two American flags, Biden remarked that his campaign ""has had a very good night"" and is moving closer to securing the Democratic presidential nomination. He also thanked election officials and poll workers in the three states with in-person voting for ensuring people could cast their ballots while also remaining safe. ""It\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy,"" he said. Biden said that his campaign is building a broad coalition that includes support from African-Americans, the Latino community, labor, firefighters, teachers, suburban women and others. ""We\'re doing it with a common vision,"" he said, adding that he and Sanders share that vision. The former vice president also thanked Sanders and his supporters for bringing ""remarkable passion and tenacity"" to issues like healthcare, income inequality and climate change, and delivered a message directly to young Sanders supporters. ""To young votes who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you, I know what\'s at stake. I know what we have to do,"" he said. ""Our goal as a campaign and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party and to unify the nation."" Biden also praised Americans for altering their lives as public health officials rush to limit the spread of the coronavirus, saying that Americans are ""ordinary people doing extraordinary things when the need arises and today we are moving quickly to adapt our routines to meet this challenge."" ""It\'s in moments like these we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans,"" Biden said. ""The coronavirus doesn\'t care if you\'re a Democrat or Republican. It will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender or your zip code. It will touch people in positions of power as well as the most vulnerable people in our society. We\'re all in this together."" A large number of likely voters in Illinois, 87%, said they were concerned about coronavirus, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to the primary. Biden received the support of likely voters concerned about the coronavirus by about 2-to-1. Similar percentages of likely voters are worried about the direction of the nation\'s economy in 2021, and Biden received their support by a similar margin. Sixty-four percent of likely voters in the Illinois primary picked Biden over Sanders as the person they would trust more to handle a major crisis. Likely primary voters in Illinois said beating President Trump was more important to them than having a candidate who agreed with them on the issues, and 69% said Biden would have the better chance to defeat the incumbent president in November. Polling shows Biden with a commanding lead among black likely voters – getting 70% of those polled – but he also received a majority vote of white likely voters as well, securing the support of both whites with and without college degrees. He received the support of over half of men and nearly two-thirds of women. The generational divide seen throughout this election cycle was also apparent in Illinois, with Sanders taking the vast majority of likely voters under 45, and Biden getting the strong support among older voters. But older likely voters significantly outnumbered their younger counterparts: more than six in ten likely voters were over the age of 45. And while Sanders maintains strong support of likely voters who say they are very liberal – getting nearly two-thirds support among this group – they made up just over a quarter of those polled. Biden garnered strong support among likely voters who said they were ""somewhat liberal"", and did particularly well among moderates. CBS News estimates Illinois leans toward Biden. At the moment, Chicago looks to be very close between Biden and Sanders, but many more votes are expected to be counted. The current delegate allocation in Illinois has Biden with 33 delegates and Sanders with 21. There are 155 total delegates at stake in Illinois. Following wins in the Republican primaries in Illinois and Florida, President Trump has secured the delegates needed to win the Republican presidential nomination, CBS News projects. President Trump has clinched the Republican nomination.https://t.co/E3KhCZjESV pic.twitter.com/YNT7WliBd0 — CBS News (@CBSNews) March 18, 2020 Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel offered congratulations to Mr. Trump for ""officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for president.""

Only former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld remains in the race. Most likely voters in Florida said electability was a priority for them going into the primary, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to March 17. Seventy-three percent of likely voters also think Biden would have a good chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to just 21% who picked Sanders. Voters over age 45 were more likely to say they support Biden. Those who want the next president to return to Obama policies instead of more liberal policies said they would vote for Biden. Nearly half of Florida likely voters said Sanders\' issue positions were too liberal, but most said Biden\'s issue positions were about right. Florida likely voters said they trusted Biden over Sanders by a wide margin — 59% to 37% — to handle Social Security. anders addressed supporters in a livestreamed speech after polls closed in most of Florida and called for the country to come together as local, state and federal officials respond to the coronavirus. ""I think the main point to be made tonight is that in this moment of crisis, it is imperative that we stand together, understand that right now throughout this country, there are so many of our people wondering what\'s going to happen to me tomorrow?"" Sanders said. He added that ""this is a moment that we have got to be working together."" Sanders laid out a series of proposals he said he plans to present to Democratic leadership and said an adequate response will require an ""unprecedented"" amount of money."" Sanders estimated the price tag will top $2 trillion. The plans put forth by Sanders to bolster the response to the coronavirus include allowing Medicare to cover all medical bills during the public health crisis; increasing test kits for the coronavirus and the speed at which tests are processed; activating the National Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other military resources to help expand healthcare capacity; and using emergency authority to scale up production in the U.S. of critical supplies and protective equipment. Sanders also suggested a number of measures to mitigate the economic impacts for American workers and their families, including providing a $2,000 monthly cash payment to every household for the duration of the crisis, expanding Meals on Wheels and food stamps and placing a moratorium on evictions, foreclosures and utility shutoffs. ""We must make certain that the government is getting this money into the hands of working families and the most vulnerable as quickly as possible,"" he said. Sanders said the economic crisis should not be ""another money-making opportunity"" for large corporations and Wall Street. ""We\'ve got some major crisis, but I have the strong belief that if we work together, if we do not turn to fear and panic, but if we understand that the way we solve this is by going forward as one people, remembering those who are hurting tonight and will be hurting in the future,"" he said.

""The Ohio Democratic Party strongly supports concluding the primary election earlier than June 2. Extending for that long is highly problematic for any number for reasons, and it is not at all clear that in-person voting will be possible on that date anyway,"" the statement continued. At a news conference Monday, in response to a question about the possible impact of the coronavirus outbreak, President Trump said delaying elections would be ""not a very good thing."" ""I\'d leave that up to the states,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Postponing elections is not a very good thing … I think postponing is unnecessary."" A poll by Monmouth University released on Monday showed Biden with a double-digit advantage over Sanders in Arizona. Among voters likely to participate in the primary, Biden was supported by 51% to Sanders\' 31%. Sanders leads among Latino voters by seven points, and among voters under 50 years old by wide margins. But this is more than offset by Biden\'s strong advantage among larger voter blocs, including white voters and those aged 50 and over. In head-to-head matchups with the president, Biden had a small edge Mr. Trump, but the president was virtually tied with Sanders. Although Arizona has long been a solid red state, it could be a battleground this November. Mr. Trump only won the state by 4 points against Hillary Clinton in 2016. In the Senate race, Democrat Mark Kelly had a 6-point edge in the poll over incumbent Martha McSally. "',

        ArticleContent: '"Joe Biden swept all three primaries on Tuesday night in Arizona, Florida and Illinois, CBS News projects. The contests took place amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis that led Ohio officials to postpone their primary, which had also been scheduled for Tuesday. In remarks after his early win in Florida, Biden, speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, said his campaign appeared to have had a ""very good night,"" but he also spoke about the coronavirus crisis. He told Americans that ""it\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy."" Bernie Sanders gave remarks via livestream earlier in the night. He focused mainly on the coronavirus crisis and highlighted unity. Tuesday\'s lopsided results will expand the divide in delegates between Biden and Sanders. It\'s unclear when the next primary contests will be held. Georgia, which had been set to vote on March 24, has postponed its primary, as did Louisiana, which was scheduled to go to the polls on April 4. As of 12 a.m. ET on Wednesday, Biden had increased his lead to 291 delegates. Biden now has 1,093 delegates to Sanders\' 802. To get the nomination, the Democratic candidate will need 1,991 delegates. According to CBS News primary polling in Arizona, the most important candidate quality for voters was being able to unite the country. Of those voters, 65% said they voted for Biden, while just 16% went for Sanders. The poll was mostly of voters who already voted by mail and includes those who said they were likely to show up at polls today. Like Florida and Illinois voters, 69% of Arizona voters saw Biden as the candidate with the best chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to 26% who believed the same of Sanders. Biden was also seen as the candidate trusted more to handle a major crisis. Biden led among white voters by 51% to 32%. Hispanic voters were more evenly divided: Biden 45% to Sanders 44%. CBS News projects the former vice president wins the Arizona primary, finalizing Biden\'s sweep of the three states that voted. Sixty-seven pledged delegates are up for grabs in Arizona. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose cheered the decision to postpone the state\'s primary election until June 2, saying it ""saved Ohio lives."" ""By preventing Ohioans from going to polling locations, we averted a situation which would have gone against the most recent scientific evidence available and could have dangerously advanced the spread of coronavirus across Ohio,"" the two said in a joining statement. ""It is abundantly clear that it would have been impossible to carry out a fair, accessible, and safe election today."" DeWine and LaRose stressed that Ohio voters should have a ""significant"" amount of time to cast mail-in absentee ballots and also vote in-person. Less than 12 hours before the polls were set to open in Ohio, DeWine announced that Dr. Amy Acton, director of the Ohio Department of Health, would be issuing an order to close polls ""to avoid the imminent threat with the high probability of widespread exposure to COVID-19."" As of 11 p.m. ET, Biden is leading in every county in Florida. Although Hillary Clinton won the primary in 2016, Sanders won nine counties in the northern part of the state in that contest. The Arizona secretary of state has revealed that personal information related to some protected voters was erroneously included in reports generated from the state\'s voter registration database. Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said in a statement that the error was not the result of a security breach or vulnerability. Hobbs said her office was notified from a county official that an early ballot report they compiled included ""protected voters,"" or those whose information is protected due to their jobs or if they were victims of certain crimes. Seventy-eight names were mistakenly included in the reports, the secretary of state\'s office said, and the office has asked county officials to contact those who were directly impacted. The early ballot reports are produced using data from the state\'s voter registration database, and the reports are provided by counties to political parties during elections. Hobb\'s office said the process for producing reports from the voter registration database has also been updated to prevent future errors. Biden celebrated his early wins in Illinois and Florida with a solemn address to supporters calling for the country to come together in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, while also thanking Bernie Sanders and his supporters for the ""remarkable passion"" they have brought to the Democratic race. Speaking from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, with a backdrop of black cloth and flanked by two American flags, Biden remarked that his campaign ""has had a very good night"" and is moving closer to securing the Democratic presidential nomination. He also thanked election officials and poll workers in the three states with in-person voting for ensuring people could cast their ballots while also remaining safe. ""It\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy,"" he said. Biden said that his campaign is building a broad coalition that includes support from African-Americans, the Latino community, labor, firefighters, teachers, suburban women and others. ""We\'re doing it with a common vision,"" he said, adding that he and Sanders share that vision. The former vice president also thanked Sanders and his supporters for bringing ""remarkable passion and tenacity"" to issues like healthcare, income inequality and climate change, and delivered a message directly to young Sanders supporters. ""To young votes who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you, I know what\'s at stake. I know what we have to do,"" he said. ""Our goal as a campaign and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party and to unify the nation."" Biden also praised Americans for altering their lives as public health officials rush to limit the spread of the coronavirus, saying that Americans are ""ordinary people doing extraordinary things when the need arises and today we are moving quickly to adapt our routines to meet this challenge."" ""It\'s in moments like these we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans,"" Biden said. ""The coronavirus doesn\'t care if you\'re a Democrat or Republican. It will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender or your zip code. It will touch people in positions of power as well as the most vulnerable people in our society. We\'re all in this together."" A large number of likely voters in Illinois, 87%, said they were concerned about coronavirus, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to the primary. Biden received the support of likely voters concerned about the coronavirus by about 2-to-1. Similar percentages of likely voters are worried about the direction of the nation\'s economy in 2021, and Biden received their support by a similar margin. Sixty-four percent of likely voters in the Illinois primary picked Biden over Sanders as the person they would trust more to handle a major crisis. Likely primary voters in Illinois said beating President Trump was more important to them than having a candidate who agreed with them on the issues, and 69% said Biden would have the better chance to defeat the incumbent president in November. Polling shows Biden with a commanding lead among black likely voters – getting 70% of those polled – but he also received a majority vote of white likely voters as well, securing the support of both whites with and without college degrees. He received the support of over half of men and nearly two-thirds of women. The generational divide seen throughout this election cycle was also apparent in Illinois, with Sanders taking the vast majority of likely voters under 45, and Biden getting the strong support among older voters. But older likely voters significantly outnumbered their younger counterparts: more than six in ten likely voters were over the age of 45. And while Sanders maintains strong support of likely voters who say they are very liberal – getting nearly two-thirds support among this group – they made up just over a quarter of those polled. Biden garnered strong support among likely voters who said they were ""somewhat liberal"", and did particularly well among moderates. CBS News estimates Illinois leans toward Biden. At the moment, Chicago looks to be very close between Biden and Sanders, but many more votes are expected to be counted. The current delegate allocation in Illinois has Biden with 33 delegates and Sanders with 21. There are 155 total delegates at stake in Illinois. Following wins in the Republican primaries in Illinois and Florida, President Trump has secured the delegates needed to win the Republican presidential nomination, CBS News projects. President Trump has clinched the Republican nomination.https://t.co/E3KhCZjESV pic.twitter.com/YNT7WliBd0 — CBS News (@CBSNews) March 18, 2020 Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel offered congratulations to Mr. Trump for ""officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for president."" Congratulations to Donald J. Trump on officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for President! His home state of Florida just delivered him the delegates he needed. Our party is united, our grassroots movement is fired up, and we are ready for FOUR MORE YEARS! pic.twitter.com/B4X9IaQp7f — Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) March 18, 2020 Mr. Trump had several early challengers for the Republican nomination, though most dropped out of the race. Only former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld remains in the race. Most likely voters in Florida said electability was a priority for them going into the primary, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to March 17. Seventy-three percent of likely voters also think Biden would have a good chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to just 21% who picked Sanders. Voters over age 45 were more likely to say they support Biden. Those who want the next president to return to Obama policies instead of more liberal policies said they would vote for Biden. Nearly half of Florida likely voters said Sanders\' issue positions were too liberal, but most said Biden\'s issue positions were about right. Florida likely voters said they trusted Biden over Sanders by a wide margin — 59% to 37% — to handle Social Security. anders addressed supporters in a livestreamed speech after polls closed in most of Florida and called for the country to come together as local, state and federal officials respond to the coronavirus. ""I think the main point to be made tonight is that in this moment of crisis, it is imperative that we stand together, understand that right now throughout this country, there are so many of our people wondering what\'s going to happen to me tomorrow?"" Sanders said. He added that ""this is a moment that we have got to be working together."" Sanders laid out a series of proposals he said he plans to present to Democratic leadership and said an adequate response will require an ""unprecedented"" amount of money."" Sanders estimated the price tag will top $2 trillion. The plans put forth by Sanders to bolster the response to the coronavirus include allowing Medicare to cover all medical bills during the public health crisis; increasing test kits for the coronavirus and the speed at which tests are processed; activating the National Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other military resources to help expand healthcare capacity; and using emergency authority to scale up production in the U.S. of critical supplies and protective equipment. Sanders also suggested a number of measures to mitigate the economic impacts for American workers and their families, including providing a $2,000 monthly cash payment to every household for the duration of the crisis, expanding Meals on Wheels and food stamps and placing a moratorium on evictions, foreclosures and utility shutoffs. ""We must make certain that the government is getting this money into the hands of working families and the most vulnerable as quickly as possible,"" he said. Sanders said the economic crisis should not be ""another money-making opportunity"" for large corporations and Wall Street. ""We\'ve got some major crisis, but I have the strong belief that if we work together, if we do not turn to fear and panic, but if we understand that the way we solve this is by going forward as one people, remembering those who are hurting tonight and will be hurting in the future,"" he said. ""This is the richest country in the history world. This is a country with unbelievable energy, with unbelievable talent, with incredible resources. We can do it. We can address this crisis, we can minimize the pain and let us do just that."" CBS News projects Biden will win Florida, the biggest prize in Tuesday\'s primaries with 219 pledged delegates. Florida has a large Hispanic population, and Biden has previously struggled to gain support from Hispanic voters in states which have already held primaries, like Nevada. The delegate allocation at poll closing in Florida was 100 delegates for Biden, and 27 for Sanders, according to CBS News\' analysis. All polls are now closed in Florida and in Illinois, after an election day marked by fears about the spread of the coronavirus. Polls close in Arizona at 10 p.m. ET. The Ohio primary has been pushed back until June 2. Sanders will livestream remarks about the coronavirus crisis at 7:15 p.m., shortly after polls close in Florida. The speech will address how the ""response to the outbreak should put working families and the most vulnerable first,"" according to a press release from the campaign. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democrats said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Biden and Sanders have made remarks outlining their plans to respond to the crisis. The Florida Democratic Party said the number of Democrats who have voted early in person and by mail has exceeded turnout in the primaries in 2016. According to the state party, 141,560 more Democrats voted by mail this year than they did in the last presidential primary. Additionally, 74,031 more Democrats voted early in person this year than in 2016. The Florida Democratic Party also said it enrolled nearly 500,000 new Democrats into vote-by-mail in 2018. The party said that the coronavirus pandemic, which has impacted voting in states holding their contests today, demonstrates the need for the government to revamp voting methods. As the country deals with a health care crisis, the issue of health care remains on voters\' minds. In Arizona, Florida, and Illinois, voters picked health care as the issue that would be most important in determining their vote, according to CBS News primary polls. The second most important issue among voters in each of the three states was income inequality, followed by climate change and race relations. Likely Democratic voters in Illinois said they are also worried about the economy, primary polls show. More than eight in 10 are least somewhat concerned about the national economy over the next year. In the three states where voters will head to the polls Tuesday, most said they prefer the Democratic nominee be someone who can beat Trump — at least six in 10 in each state— over someone they agree with on major issues, according to CBS News primary polls. As has been the case throughout this campaign, there are high levels of dissatisfaction toward the Trump administration among the Democratic primary electorate. Large majorities of likely voters in Florida and Illinois and those who voted by mail in Arizona said they feel angry about the Trump administration. Among likely Democratic voters in Illinois, more Sanders supporters said they would be unhappy about Biden being the nominee than Biden supporters would be if Sanders became the nominee, according to primary polls. Fifty-four percent of Sanders supporters would be dissatisfied or upset if Biden won the nomination, compared to 37% of Biden backers who would feel that way if Sanders became the nominee. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democratic voters said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Among those polled in Florida, 71% said they trusted Biden more, compared to 23% who said Sanders is the candidate they trust to handle a major crisis. In Illinois, 64% of Democratic voters selected Biden while 31% said Sanders is more trusted, and in Arizona, 63% said they trust Biden more to handle a major crisis compared to 31%, who pointed to Sanders. The Democratic National Committee is calling on states that haven\'t yet held their primaries to vote by mail, as coronavirus threatens future primaries. ""The simplest tool is vote by mail, which is already in use in a number of states and should be made available to all registered voters. States using vote by mail should proactively mail ballots to registered voters, where feasible, and should count all ballots as long as they are postmarked by the date of the primary,"" DNC chair Tom Perez said in a statement on Wednesday. Where in-person voting can take place in accordance with health guidelines, states should expand the days and hours of early voting to cut down on lines, Perez added. According to CBS News primary polls, nearly all likely voters in Illinois expressed at least some concern about the effects of the coronavirus, including more than half who said they are very concerned about it. Most likely voters of all ages in Illinois said they are concerned, but older voters are particularly so: 62% of voters ages 45 and over say they are very concerned, compared to 38% of younger voters. Women (59%) were also more likely than men (46%) to be very concerned. Some voters, meanwhile, said the coronavirus could change their decision to vote. In Florida, among those who said they would definitely vote and planned to do so in person on Election Day, 15% said it was very or somewhat likely that they could change their decision to vote. In Illinois, that figure was 9%, according to primary polls. The Biden campaign is optimistic it will walk away from Tuesday\'s primaries with a wider delegate lead than it had going into the contests despite the challenges to voter turnout raised because of the coronavirus. ""It would take a drastic, historically-incomparable swing for Senator Sanders to win more delegates than Biden today or to close the delegate differential,"" the campaign said in a memo released Tuesday. Heading into the four primaries held on Tuesday, Biden led Sanders by more than 100 delegates. The former vice president\'s campaign also noted that while fewer people may head to the polls on Election Day because of the coronavirus, it expects overall turnout to match that of past elections. ""While voter turnout on Election Day itself may be lower due to COVID-19 concerns, we believe that, with early vote and vote by mail, overall turnout will be roughly on pace for 2016 in Arizona and Florida and roughly on pace for 2018 in Illinois, and that voter turnout in all three states will reflect the population at large,"" the campaign said in the memo. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, on Tuesday defended the decision to keep the polls open despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. ""There are people out there today who want to say, \'Oh, it\'s a crisis, bend the rules and overstep your authority,\'"" Pritzker said. ""Let me tell you this, It is exactly in times like these, when the constitutional boundaries of our democracy should be respected above all else. And if people want to criticize me for that, well, go ahead. I\'ll wear it like a badge of honor."" Earlier Tuesday, Chicago Board of Elections spokesman Jim Allen said he urged Pritzker to prohibit voting in person and go fully vote-by-mail. Allen later apologized for the remarks. The Chicago Board of Elections said they said they\'ve had to move in total 200 precincts, with some locations in the city dropping out as soon as this morning (these cases were immediately moved to a new location). In Chicago, 126,499 votes have been cast through 2 p.m. ET, with a surge after the first two hours. Biden tweeted a reminder about polls being open in Arizona, Florida and Illinois. ""I encourage folks to vote by mail or curbside vote if you can,"" Biden wrote. ""If you vote in person, please wash your hands, don\'t touch your face, and stay 6\' from others in line."" Maryland Governor Larry Hogan announced at a press conference on Tuesday morning that the state will move its primary from April 28 until June 2. The state Board of Elections issued a statement shortly after that ""fully supports"" Hogan\'s decision. The decision follows similar action in Georgia, Kentucky and Louisiana. In a last-minute move on Monday, Ohio postponed its primary. The Ohio State Supreme Court denied a challenge to Ohio\'s primary delay filed by Wood County judicial candidate Corey Speweik, who was fighting the state of Ohio\'s decision to shut down Tuesday\'s primary and postpone voting until June over concern about the spread of the coronavirus. The process leading up to the delay was chaotic. With less than 12 hours to go before polls were scheduled to open in Ohio for the state\'s presidential primary election, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, announced polls would remain closed Tuesday amid concerns over the coronavirus. The decision came just hours after a Franklin County judge denied a request backed by the governor and secretary of state to delay the election. The Ohio Democratic Party said in a statement Tuesday that although voting did not seem feasible, it hoped the primary would be rescheduled for earlier than June 2. ""Given the chaos, confusion and mixed messages of the past 24 hours, it\'s clearly impossible for in-person voting to move forward today in Ohio,"" the party said in a statement. ""The Ohio Democratic Party strongly supports concluding the primary election earlier than June 2. Extending for that long is highly problematic for any number for reasons, and it is not at all clear that in-person voting will be possible on that date anyway,"" the statement continued. At a news conference Monday, in response to a question about the possible impact of the coronavirus outbreak, President Trump said delaying elections would be ""not a very good thing."" ""I\'d leave that up to the states,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Postponing elections is not a very good thing … I think postponing is unnecessary.""

""It\'s important to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy,"" he said. Biden said that his campaign is building a broad coalition that includes support from African-Americans, the Latino community, labor, firefighters, teachers, suburban women and others. ""We\'re doing it with a common vision,"" he said, adding that he and Sanders share that vision. The former vice president also thanked Sanders and his supporters for bringing ""remarkable passion and tenacity"" to issues like healthcare, income inequality and climate change, and delivered a message directly to young Sanders supporters. ""To young votes who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you, I know what\'s at stake. I know what we have to do,"" he said. ""Our goal as a campaign and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party and to unify the nation."" Biden also praised Americans for altering their lives as public health officials rush to limit the spread of the coronavirus, saying that Americans are ""ordinary people doing extraordinary things when the need arises and today we are moving quickly to adapt our routines to meet this challenge."" ""It\'s in moments like these we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans,"" Biden said. ""The coronavirus doesn\'t care if you\'re a Democrat or Republican. It will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender or your zip code. It will touch people in positions of power as well as the most vulnerable people in our society. We\'re all in this together."" A large number of likely voters in Illinois, 87%, said they were concerned about coronavirus, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to the primary. Biden received the support of likely voters concerned about the coronavirus by about 2-to-1. Similar percentages of likely voters are worried about the direction of the nation\'s economy in 2021, and Biden received their support by a similar margin. Sixty-four percent of likely voters in the Illinois primary picked Biden over Sanders as the person they would trust more to handle a major crisis. Likely primary voters in Illinois said beating President Trump was more important to them than having a candidate who agreed with them on the issues, and 69% said Biden would have the better chance to defeat the incumbent president in November. Polling shows Biden with a commanding lead among black likely voters – getting 70% of those polled – but he also received a majority vote of white likely voters as well, securing the support of both whites with and without college degrees. He received the support of over half of men and nearly two-thirds of women. The generational divide seen throughout this election cycle was also apparent in Illinois, with Sanders taking the vast majority of likely voters under 45, and Biden getting the strong support among older voters. But older likely voters significantly outnumbered their younger counterparts: more than six in ten likely voters were over the age of 45. And while Sanders maintains strong support of likely voters who say they are very liberal – getting nearly two-thirds support among this group – they made up just over a quarter of those polled. Biden garnered strong support among likely voters who said they were ""somewhat liberal"", and did particularly well among moderates. CBS News estimates Illinois leans toward Biden. At the moment, Chicago looks to be very close between Biden and Sanders, but many more votes are expected to be counted. The current delegate allocation in Illinois has Biden with 33 delegates and Sanders with 21. There are 155 total delegates at stake in Illinois. Following wins in the Republican primaries in Illinois and Florida, President Trump has secured the delegates needed to win the Republican presidential nomination, CBS News projects. President Trump has clinched the Republican nomination.https://t.co/E3KhCZjESV pic.twitter.com/YNT7WliBd0 — CBS News (@CBSNews) March 18, 2020 Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel offered congratulations to Mr. Trump for ""officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for president."" Congratulations to Donald J. Trump on officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for President! His home state of Florida just delivered him the delegates he needed. Our party is united, our grassroots movement is fired up, and we are ready for FOUR MORE YEARS! pic.twitter.com/B4X9IaQp7f — Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) March 18, 2020 Mr. Trump had several early challengers for the Republican nomination, though most dropped out of the race. Only former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld remains in the race. Most likely voters in Florida said electability was a priority for them going into the primary, according to CBS News primary polling in the days leading up to March 17. Seventy-three percent of likely voters also think Biden would have a good chance of beating Mr. Trump, compared to just 21% who picked Sanders. Voters over age 45 were more likely to say they support Biden. Those who want the next president to return to Obama policies instead of more liberal policies said they would vote for Biden. Nearly half of Florida likely voters said Sanders\' issue positions were too liberal, but most said Biden\'s issue positions were about right. Florida likely voters said they trusted Biden over Sanders by a wide margin — 59% to 37% — to handle Social Security. anders addressed supporters in a livestreamed speech after polls closed in most of Florida and called for the country to come together as local, state and federal officials respond to the coronavirus. ""I think the main point to be made tonight is that in this moment of crisis, it is imperative that we stand together, understand that right now throughout this country, there are so many of our people wondering what\'s going to happen to me tomorrow?"" Sanders said. He added that ""this is a moment that we have got to be working together."" Sanders laid out a series of proposals he said he plans to present to Democratic leadership and said an adequate response will require an ""unprecedented"" amount of money."" Sanders estimated the price tag will top $2 trillion. The plans put forth by Sanders to bolster the response to the coronavirus include allowing Medicare to cover all medical bills during the public health crisis; increasing test kits for the coronavirus and the speed at which tests are processed; activating the National Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other military resources to help expand healthcare capacity; and using emergency authority to scale up production in the U.S. of critical supplies and protective equipment. Sanders also suggested a number of measures to mitigate the economic impacts for American workers and their families, including providing a $2,000 monthly cash payment to every household for the duration of the crisis, expanding Meals on Wheels and food stamps and placing a moratorium on evictions, foreclosures and utility shutoffs. ""We must make certain that the government is getting this money into the hands of working families and the most vulnerable as quickly as possible,"" he said. Sanders said the economic crisis should not be ""another money-making opportunity"" for large corporations and Wall Street. ""We\'ve got some major crisis, but I have the strong belief that if we work together, if we do not turn to fear and panic, but if we understand that the way we solve this is by going forward as one people, remembering those who are hurting tonight and will be hurting in the future,"" he said. ""This is the richest country in the history world. This is a country with unbelievable energy, with unbelievable talent, with incredible resources. We can do it. We can address this crisis, we can minimize the pain and let us do just that."" CBS News projects Biden will win Florida, the biggest prize in Tuesday\'s primaries with 219 pledged delegates. Florida has a large Hispanic population, and Biden has previously struggled to gain support from Hispanic voters in states which have already held primaries, like Nevada. The delegate allocation at poll closing in Florida was 100 delegates for Biden, and 27 for Sanders, according to CBS News\' analysis. All polls are now closed in Florida and in Illinois, after an election day marked by fears about the spread of the coronavirus. Polls close in Arizona at 10 p.m. ET. The Ohio primary has been pushed back until June 2. Sanders will livestream remarks about the coronavirus crisis at 7:15 p.m., shortly after polls close in Florida. The speech will address how the ""response to the outbreak should put working families and the most vulnerable first,"" according to a press release from the campaign. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democrats said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Biden and Sanders have made remarks outlining their plans to respond to the crisis. The Florida Democratic Party said the number of Democrats who have voted early in person and by mail has exceeded turnout in the primaries in 2016. According to the state party, 141,560 more Democrats voted by mail this year than they did in the last presidential primary. Additionally, 74,031 more Democrats voted early in person this year than in 2016. The Florida Democratic Party also said it enrolled nearly 500,000 new Democrats into vote-by-mail in 2018. The party said that the coronavirus pandemic, which has impacted voting in states holding their contests today, demonstrates the need for the government to revamp voting methods. As the country deals with a health care crisis, the issue of health care remains on voters\' minds. In Arizona, Florida, and Illinois, voters picked health care as the issue that would be most important in determining their vote, according to CBS News primary polls. The second most important issue among voters in each of the three states was income inequality, followed by climate change and race relations. Likely Democratic voters in Illinois said they are also worried about the economy, primary polls show. More than eight in 10 are least somewhat concerned about the national economy over the next year. In the three states where voters will head to the polls Tuesday, most said they prefer the Democratic nominee be someone who can beat Trump — at least six in 10 in each state— over someone they agree with on major issues, according to CBS News primary polls. As has been the case throughout this campaign, there are high levels of dissatisfaction toward the Trump administration among the Democratic primary electorate. Large majorities of likely voters in Florida and Illinois and those who voted by mail in Arizona said they feel angry about the Trump administration. Among likely Democratic voters in Illinois, more Sanders supporters said they would be unhappy about Biden being the nominee than Biden supporters would be if Sanders became the nominee, according to primary polls. Fifty-four percent of Sanders supporters would be dissatisfied or upset if Biden won the nomination, compared to 37% of Biden backers who would feel that way if Sanders became the nominee. CBS News primary polls show that among likely voters in Florida and Illinois, and among those who voted by mail in Arizona, Democratic voters said Biden is the candidate they trust more to handle a major crisis. Among those polled in Florida, 71% said they trusted Biden more, compared to 23% who said Sanders is the candidate they trust to handle a major crisis. In Illinois, 64% of Democratic voters selected Biden while 31% said Sanders is more trusted, and in Arizona, 63% said they trust Biden more to handle a major crisis compared to 31%, who pointed to Sanders. The Democratic National Committee is calling on states that haven\'t yet held their primaries to vote by mail, as coronavirus threatens future primaries. ""The simplest tool is vote by mail, which is already in use in a number of states and should be made available to all registered voters. States using vote by mail should proactively mail ballots to registered voters, where feasible, and should count all ballots as long as they are postmarked by the date of the primary,"" DNC chair Tom Perez said in a statement on Wednesday. Where in-person voting can take place in accordance with health guidelines, states should expand the days and hours of early voting to cut down on lines, Perez added. According to CBS News primary polls, nearly all likely voters in Illinois expressed at least some concern about the effects of the coronavirus, including more than half who said they are very concerned about it. Most likely voters of all ages in Illinois said they are concerned, but older voters are particularly so: 62% of voters ages 45 and over say they are very concerned, compared to 38% of younger voters. Women (59%) were also more likely than men (46%) to be very concerned. Some voters, meanwhile, said the coronavirus could change their decision to vote. In Florida, among those who said they would definitely vote and planned to do so in person on Election Day, 15% said it was very or somewhat likely that they could change their decision to vote. In Illinois, that figure was 9%, according to primary polls. The Biden campaign is optimistic it will walk away from Tuesday\'s primaries with a wider delegate lead than it had going into the contests despite the challenges to voter turnout raised because of the coronavirus. ""It would take a drastic, historically-incomparable swing for Senator Sanders to win more delegates than Biden today or to close the delegate differential,"" the campaign said in a memo released Tuesday. Heading into the four primaries held on Tuesday, Biden led Sanders by more than 100 delegates. The former vice president\'s campaign also noted that while fewer people may head to the polls on Election Day because of the coronavirus, it expects overall turnout to match that of past elections. ""While voter turnout on Election Day itself may be lower due to COVID-19 concerns, we believe that, with early vote and vote by mail, overall turnout will be roughly on pace for 2016 in Arizona and Florida and roughly on pace for 2018 in Illinois, and that voter turnout in all three states will reflect the population at large,"" the campaign said in the memo. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, on Tuesday defended the decision to keep the polls open despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. ""There are people out there today who want to say, \'Oh, it\'s a crisis, bend the rules and overstep your authority,\'"" Pritzker said. ""Let me tell you this, It is exactly in times like these, when the constitutional boundaries of our democracy should be respected above all else. And if people want to criticize me for that, well, go ahead. I\'ll wear it like a badge of honor."" Earlier Tuesday, Chicago Board of Elections spokesman Jim Allen said he urged Pritzker to prohibit voting in person and go fully vote-by-mail. Allen later apologized for the remarks. The Chicago Board of Elections said they said they\'ve had to move in total 200 precincts, with some locations in the city dropping out as soon as this morning (these cases were immediately moved to a new location). In Chicago, 126,499 votes have been cast through 2 p.m. ET, with a surge after the first two hours. Biden tweeted a reminder about polls being open in Arizona, Florida and Illinois. ""I encourage folks to vote by mail or curbside vote if you can,"" Biden wrote. ""If you vote in person, please wash your hands, don\'t touch your face, and stay 6\' from others in line."" Maryland Governor Larry Hogan announced at a press conference on Tuesday morning that the state will move its primary from April 28 until June 2. The state Board of Elections issued a statement shortly after that ""fully supports"" Hogan\'s decision. The decision follows similar action in Georgia, Kentucky and Louisiana. In a last-minute move on Monday, Ohio postponed its primary. The Ohio State Supreme Court denied a challenge to Ohio\'s primary delay filed by Wood County judicial candidate Corey Speweik, who was fighting the state of Ohio\'s decision to shut down Tuesday\'s primary and postpone voting until June over concern about the spread of the coronavirus. The process leading up to the delay was chaotic. With less than 12 hours to go before polls were scheduled to open in Ohio for the state\'s presidential primary election, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, announced polls would remain closed Tuesday amid concerns over the coronavirus. The decision came just hours after a Franklin County judge denied a request backed by the governor and secretary of state to delay the election. The Ohio Democratic Party said in a statement Tuesday that although voting did not seem feasible, it hoped the primary would be rescheduled for earlier than June 2. ""Given the chaos, confusion and mixed messages of the past 24 hours, it\'s clearly impossible for in-person voting to move forward today in Ohio,"" the party said in a statement. ""The Ohio Democratic Party strongly supports concluding the primary election earlier than June 2. Extending for that long is highly problematic for any number for reasons, and it is not at all clear that in-person voting will be possible on that date anyway,"" the statement continued. At a news conference Monday, in response to a question about the possible impact of the coronavirus outbreak, President Trump said delaying elections would be ""not a very good thing."" ""I\'d leave that up to the states,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Postponing elections is not a very good thing … I think postponing is unnecessary."" A poll by Monmouth University released on Monday showed Biden with a double-digit advantage over Sanders in Arizona. Among voters likely to participate in the primary, Biden was supported by 51% to Sanders\' 31%. Sanders leads among Latino voters by seven points, and among voters under 50 years old by wide margins. But this is more than offset by Biden\'s strong advantage among larger voter blocs, including white voters and those aged 50 and over. In head-to-head matchups with the president, Biden had a small edge Mr. Trump, but the president was virtually tied with Sanders. Although Arizona has long been a solid red state, it could be a battleground this November. Mr. Trump only won the state by 4 points against Hillary Clinton in 2016. In the Senate race, Democrat Mark Kelly had a 6-point edge in the poll over incumbent Martha McSally. "',

In a promotional video made public this week, Ramdev, in his trademark saffron robes and clutching a sample of the medicinal plant produced by Patanjali, the company he co-founded, says: “We’ve done scientific research and found Ashwagandha ... doesn’t allow blending of corona protein with human protein.” He did not provide evidence for the research, which he said had been sent to an unspecified international journal. There are currently no vaccines or drugs approved to treat or prevent COVID-19, only investigational COVID-19 vaccines and treatments under development. “These kinds of messages give a false sense of security. People who are not well educated, they are the ones who will get misled,” said Dr. Giridhar Babu, a professor of epidemiology at the Public Health Foundation of India, urging the government to ban such advertisements. Even potentially harmless tweets about immunity risk confusing people, Babu added. Multiple calls and emails seeking comment from Patanjali and Ramdev went unanswered.

Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014 created the Ministry of Ayush to promote and regulate ayurvedic remedies and yoga.

        ArticleContent: '"A study revealed that people with blood type A had higher chances to develop more severe symptoms People with blood type O “had a significantly lower risk for the infectious disease"" “If you are type A, there is no need to panic. It does not mean you will be infected 100 percent,"" a scientist said A recent study in China stated that there were more possibilities that people with blood type A could get coronavirus when compared to the other blood groups. For the study, the researchers took blood group patterns of over 2,000 patients infected with coronavirus in Wuhan and Shenzhen and compared it with “normal people from the corresponding regions.” It was revealed that people with blood type A were more vulnerable to infection and had higher chances to develop more severe symptoms. “People of blood group A might need particularly strengthened personal protection to reduce the chance of infection,” the researchers wrote, adding, “Sars-CoV-2-infected patients with blood group A might need to receive more vigilant surveillance and aggressive treatment.” On the other hand, people with blood type O “had a significantly lower risk for the infectious disease compared with non-O blood groups.” “It might be helpful to introduce ABO blood typing in both patients and medical personnel as a routine part of the management of Sars-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections, to help define the management options and assess risk exposure levels of people,” the research paper stated.

        AnswerContent: "\"A person's blood type may make them more susceptible to catching the novel coronavirus spreading around the world, a new study claims.  People with type A blood are 63 per cent more likely to catch the virus than an individual with type O blood.  It also appears people with type A blood are more likely to die from COVID-19.  Of 206 patients in the study who died, 85 had type A blood — 63 per cent more than the 52 people who died and were type O. The coronavirus pandemic has infected almost 200,000 people and killed more than 7,800 worldwide. More than 3,000 deaths were in China, the disease's ground-zero.  Researchers in China assessed 2,173 people who had been diagnosed with coronavirus, including 206 people who died from after contracting the virus, from three hospitals in Hubei. Academics compared this data to 3,694 non-infected people from the country. A total of 1,775 people who tested positive for COVID-19 were at Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital and of these infected individuals, the percentage of people with type A blood was significantly higher than in the general public.  Of all coronavirus diagnoses, 38 per cent were people with type A blood but in the general public this figure is just 32  per cent.  In contrast, type O people make up 34 per cent of uninfected people but just 26 per cent of infected patients.  'People of blood group A might need particularly strengthened personal protection to reduce the chance of infection,' wrote the researchers in their paper, which has not yet been peer-reviewed but has been published online on medrxiv.  'Sars-CoV-2-infected patients with blood group A might need to receive more vigilant surveillance and aggressive treatment. ' The researchers add: 'It might be helpful to introduce ABO blood typing in both patients and medical personnel as a routine part of the management of Sars-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections, to help define the management options and assess risk exposure levels of people'.  A coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown. The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2. Experts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it. The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. Dr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals.  'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses).  'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.'  The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31. By January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge. The first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.  Where does the virus come from? According to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats. Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals – the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively. The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation. Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat.  A study by the Wuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats. However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was. Dr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China. 'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.'   So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it?  Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly. It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19. Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold. Speaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them. 'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.' If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die.  'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in. 'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.' How does the virus spread? The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms. It is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces. Originally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person.  What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms? Once someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms – but they may still be contagious during this time. If and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever (high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all. In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people. Figures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why.  What have genetic tests revealed about the virus?  Scientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world.  This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause.    Examinations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much – changing is known as mutating – much during the early stages of its spread. However, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people. This means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it.    More study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately. How dangerous is the virus?   The virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people. Experts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is. However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true. Dr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, Stat News reported. Can the virus be cured?  The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money. No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above. The National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology. Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people. People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public. And airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature). However, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport. Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic?    The outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'.  Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world.\"",

Why are health experts so worried about it?  Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly. It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19. Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold. Speaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them. 'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.' If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die.  'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in. 'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.' How does the virus spread? The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms. It is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces. Originally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person.  What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms? Once someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms – but they may still be contagious during this time. If and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever (high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all. In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people. Figures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why.  What have genetic tests revealed about the virus?  Scientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world.  This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause.    Examinations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much – changing is known as mutating – much during the early stages of its spread. However, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people. This means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it.    More study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately. How dangerous is the virus?   The virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people. Experts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is. However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true. Dr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, Stat News reported. Can the virus be cured?  The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money. No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above. The National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology. Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people. People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public. And airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature). However, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport. Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic?    The outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'.  Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world.\"",
